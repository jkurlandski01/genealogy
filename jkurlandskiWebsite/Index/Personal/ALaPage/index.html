				<h3>What I've Been Reading</h3>
            </div>
        <br/>

            <p>Here are some of the best, or at least some of the more interesting, things that I've been reading lately.</p>
            
            <h3>Michael Eric Dyson, "The Ghost of Cornel West," <em>The New Republic</em>, May 2015</h3>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">The ecstasies of the spoken word, when scholarship is at stake, leave the deep reader and the long listener hungry for more. Writing is an often-painful task that can feel like the death of one's past. Equally discomifiting is seeing one's present commitments to truths crumble once one begins to tap away at the keyboard or scar the page with ink. Writing demands a different sort of apprenticeship to ideas than does speaking. It beckons one to revisit over an extended, or at least delayed, period the same material and to revise what one thinks. Revision is reading again and again what one writes so that one can think again and again about what one wants to say and in turn detemine if better and deeper things can be said.</p>
        <br/>

            <h3>Manohla Dargis, "Review: ‘Chappie’: a Smart Robot in a Violent Future," <em>New York Times</em>, March 6, 2015</h3>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">Given the big studio way, it’s no surprise that the robots, with their matte gray cladding and rabbit ears, swiveling heads and articulated limbs, have been created with more attention to detail than the story.</p>
        <br/>

            <h3>David Byrne, "Emergent Storytelling," and Our Making Sense of Others' Words</h3>
            <p>About two-thirds through David Byrne's <i>How Music Works</i>, he describes how he often goes about writing lyrics for songs. I was reminded of some of my other reading, on artificial dialog systems (aka chatbots).</p>
            <p>First, David Byrne:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">Writing words to fit an existing melody and meter, as I did on <i>Everything That Happens</i> and many other records, is something anyone who writes in rhyme does naturally and intuitively&mdash;every rapper improvises or composes to a meter, for example. I had been encouraged to make this process, which is usually internalized, more explicit when I was writing the words for <i>Remain in Light</i>. That was the first time I tackled a whole record of lyrics this way. I found that, remarkably, solving the puzzle of making words and phrases fit existing structures often resulted, somewhat surprisingly, in words that have an emotional consistency and sometimes even a narrative thread, even though those aspects of the texts weren't planned ahead of time.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">How does this happen? With <i>Remain in Light</i> and even before that, I would look for words that fit pre-existing melodic fragments that I or others had come up with. After filling lots of pages with non-sequitors, I would scan them to see if a lyrically resonant group emerged. Phrases that would hint at the beginning of an actual subject often seemed to <i>want</i> to emerge. This might seem magical&mdash;claiming a text "wants" to come into being (and we've heard this said before), but it's true. When some phrases, even if collected almost at random, begin to resonate together and appear to be talking about the same thing, it's tempting to claim they have a life of their own. The lyrics may have begun as gibberish, but often, though not always, a "story" in the broadest sense emerges. Emergent storytelling, one might say. (<i>How Music Works</i>, p. 198-199)</p>
            <p>With apologies to Mr. Byrne, what <i>I</i> think is happening when the phrases begin to "resonate together and appear to be talking about the same thing," is not so much the work of the phrases, but the operation of the human mind. In this case we are talking about the mind of the lyricist as well as the mind of the eventual listeners of the song. Below I've pasted the long passage which David Byrne's description reminded me of, but no doubt I could find something just as relevant in some of Grice's writings.</p>
            <p>From "A Robot in the Kitchen," by Peter Wallis (in which I've bold-faced the passages most relevant to my point):</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">Paul Seedhouse (Seedhouse, 2004) summarises the outcome of the last 50 years of CA (Conversation Analysis) research as with the observation that a conversational partner’s utterance will, in the normal case, go seen but unnoticed. That is, the utterance is an answer to a question, a response to a greeting or, more formally the second pair part of an adjacency pair. This is something computers can handle. A common occurrence is however where an utterance goes noticed and accounted for. In this case the conversational partner does not produce the expected response but what they do say makes sense. <b>Indeed the conversational partner will work hard to produce the accounting.</b> This is Eggins and Slade (Eggins and Slade, 1997) introducing sequential relevance:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="margin-left: 70px; line-height: 1">Consider, for example, the two turns at talk below:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="margin-left: 70px; line-height: 1">A: What’s that floating in the wine?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="margin-left: 70px; line-height: 1">B: There aren’t any other solutions.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="margin-left: 70px; line-height: 1">You will try very hard to find a way of interpreting B’s turn as somehow an answer to A’s question, even though there is no obvious link between them, apart from their appearance in sequence. Perhaps you will have decided that B took a common solution to a resistant wine cork and poked it through into the bottle, and it was floating in the wine. <b>Whatever explanation you came up with, it is unlikely that you looked at the example and simply said “it doesn’t make sense”, so strong is the implication that adjacent turns relate to each other.</b></p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">Having a machine account for human utterances is of course tricky but conversely the human conversational partner will work hard to account for what are actually machine failings.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">If you fail to account for your CP’s (Conversational Partner's) utterance, then your CP risks sanction. When your CP is a chat-bot, that sanction is likely, it seems, to take the form of swearing. As a classic example of a machine’s interaction eliciting sanctions, here is a conversation from the 1996 Lobner Competition:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: G’day mate.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: G’day. How’s it going?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: My mother once said ”How it is going is a mystery.” She was a bit nuts.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: Uh-huh.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: Are you still learning to speak, my friend?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: NO, no. But your anecdote took me a bit by surprise.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: How was your morning?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: Oh well, that’s a pity!</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: I’m sorry; what’s a pity?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: Apologies accepted.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: I feel compelled to insult you and we’ve only been talking a minute.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: We are bloody well talking, aren’t we?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: Oh baby. We sure are. So here are some keywords for you: shit mother baseball.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">This was the winning entry from that year but the point is not the system, but how the human responds. (Peter Wallis: "A Robot in the Kitchen," p. 29; bold-face mine)</p>
            
            <p>In other words, maybe a real human being like David Byrne can get away with a decision to "stop making sense," but if you're a conversational cyborg, you'd better "keep making sense," or you might make people really mad.</p>

            </div>
             <p>Again with apologies, here is a rough draft of "Once in a Lifetime," a song on the <i>Remain in Light</i> album, badly scanned by myself from David Byrne's book. His comment: "Judging by the fact that on this particular page there are actual stanzas and couplets, I suspect I was pretty far along in the process&mdash;earlier pages would have included anything, absolutely anything, that fit the meter and syllabic form, and might not have included any rhymes or be on a trajectory toward a subject." (p. 161-162)</p>

            <h3>June Melby, <em>My Family and Other Hazards</em></h3>
            <p>A couple of nice lines from this very good memoir.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">"In heaven you will work&mdash;it will be fun, but you will work. You spend your life working, why wouldn't you have a job in heaven? Once we find out we're good at something, we get to do it in heaven, too."</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">What am I good at? Being sarcastic. That sure will be a fun job in heaven. Perhaps uncommon and therefore very much needed.</p>

            <h3>John Haywood, <em>The Penguin Historical Atlas of Ancient Civilizations</em></h3>
            <p>This book, clear and concise, was a great way for me to fill in a lot of blanks in my knowledge of pre-Roman times. What made the biggest impression on me, however, were not the words but the pictures.</p>
            <p>Below I try to give a sense of some of the images of ancient art and architecture that I found most evocative of those distant times. In every case, the words are John Haywood's; the images are as close I could find to the images he is describing&mdash;sometimes I was lucky and found the exact picture, but other times I had to settle for an image that merely approximated the photos his book contains.</p>

            <p>Colossal stone heads, a typical feature of the Olmec civilization, are thought to represent rulers who were probably deified and worshipped as ancestors. The Olmecs are regarded as the 'mother culture' of Mesoamerica. Their civilization flourished between 1300 and 400 BC. (Op. cit., p. 13)</p>

            <p>This stone carving comes from the King's Grave, known as Kungagraven, at Kivik in southern Sweden.

            <p>This fresco of a leaping bull and three acrobats comes from the Minoan palace of Knossos in Crete. The Minoans, who created the first civilization in Europe, are famous for their lavish palaces with their vibrant wall paintings. The use of colour, pattern and dynamic movement in Minoan art makes it distinct from that of other Mediterranean cultures. (Op. cit., p. 90)</p>

            <p>The north entrance of Knossos, the most important palace of the Minoan civilization. After the first palace was completely destroyed by fire in 1700 BC, it was rebuilt according to a more complex plan. (Op. cit., p. 98)</p>

            <p>The palace at Knossos was build on a sloping site, and in places was up to five storeys high. The reconstructed ruins seen here give a good impression of its complex architecture and high standard of masonry. (Op. cit., p. 99)</p>

                The North Ship
                    <i>Legend</i>

        I saw three ships go sailing by,
        Over the sea, the lifting sea,
        And the wind rose in the morning sky,
        And one was rigged for a long journey.

        The first ship turned towards the west,
        Over the sea, the running sea,
        And by the wind was all possessed
        And carried to a rich country.

        The second ship turned towards the east,
        Over the sea, the quaking sea,
        And the wind hunted it like a beast
        To anchor in captivity.

        The third ship drove towards the north,
        Over the sea, the darkening sea,
        But no breath of wind came forth,
        And the decks shone frostily.

        The northern sky rose high and black
        Over the proud unfruitful sea,
        East and west the ships came back
        Happily or unhappily:

        But the third went wide and far
        Into an unforgiving sea
        Under a fire-spilling star,
        And it was rigged for a long journey.

            <h3>Baranoff, Brockett and Kahane: <em>Risk Management for Enterprises and Individuals</em> (2009)</h3>
            <p>It's hard for us to imagine that only a few centuries ago people did not believe even in the existence of chance occurrences or random events or in accidents, much less explore any method of quantifying seemingly chance events. Up until very recently, people have believed that God controlled every minute detail of the universe. This belief rules out any kind of conceptualization of chance as a regular or predictable phenomenon.</p>
            <p>[...] If all things are believed to be governed by an omnipotent god, then regularity is not to be trusted, perhaps it can even be considered deceptive, and variation is irrelevant and illusive, being merely reflective of God's will.</p>
            
            <h3>Alexander Nussbaum, commenting on Baranoff, Brockett and Kahane, above: "In Praise of Statistics" (<em>Free Inquiry</em>, December 2014/January 2015)</h3>
            <p>Probablistic thinking is an inherently new way of cognition, requiring a worldview that allows for randomness. Statistics as a field of inquiry depends on different reasoning than mathematics, which is a purely logical enterprise.</p>
            <p>[...] Without the concept of randomness, it is impossible to do an experiment, because experimental proof comes down to seeing how the results of a procedure differ from what randomness would produce. If one believes the outcome of any procedure is due to the will of God, there is no point in experimentation. Indeed, that is why the concept of science is so foreign to the vast majority of human cultures and history.</p>
            <p>[...] An evolved cognitive fallacy [that is, an intellectual mistake that we as a species share&mdash;paraphrase mine] is the attributing of meaning and significance to coincidences. The concept of randomness was alien to ancient thought. Indeed, it remains alien to all but a tiny strand of recent Western thought. Replacing providence with random chance was necessary for science and progress.</p>
            
            <h3>D. Cameron Webb: "Honest Atheism" (<em>Free Inquiry</em>, December 2014/January 2015)</h3>
            <p>[Webb's reply to the argument that <em>If atheism is true, our sufferings are ultimately pointless and our lives and loves do not at all matter in a larger sense.</em>] If atheism is true, everything is <em>ultimately</em> pointless. Nothing matters <em>in a larger sense</em>. Time will wipe all of us from existence. Indeed, it will probably wipe the universe from existence. [...] You'd have to be a complete fool, though, to think that this means your <em>life</em> is pointless or doesn't matter. Our lives matter simply because they matter to us and to those who love us. Our lives have meaning and purpose every time we strive toward a worthy goal. This theistic notion that we have to have ultimate purpose in order to find local purpose, or that our lives must mean something to the universe in order for them to mean something to us, is certifiable nonsense to an atheist.</p>
            
            <h3>Clive James: Review of <em>Phillip Larkin</em> by James Booth (<em>NYT Book Review</em>, November 23, 2014)</h3>
            <p>Booth has a good ear for Larkin's real-life speech. When Larkin helped to finance the publication of his first major collection, "The Less Deceived," by agreeing that it be sold by subscription, he privately called the subscribers "the sucker list." But he was joking, and one of the many merits of Booth's book is that he can spot Larkin's jokes. Larkin spoke and wrote the allusive, indirect and ironic tongue of the British literary world. In a time that grows more literal-minded almost as fast as it grows less literary, a tongue in the cheek will always need translating, especially to Americans, who expect honesty.</p>

            <h3>Albert Camus: <em>The Stranger</em> (translation mine)</h3>
            <h4>Marie's Proposal</h4>
            <p>That evening Marie came over and asked if I wanted to marry her. I said it was all the same to me&mdash;we could if she wanted to. Then she wanted to know if I loved her. I told her what I'd already told her&mdash;since I thought love was a meaningless idea, I couldn't possibly love her. "Why marry me, then?" she said. I told her it didn't matter, but if she wanted to marry we could. Besides, it was her idea&mdash;all I did was say yes. She pointed out that marriage was a serious thing. I replied, "No, it's not." For a moment she looked at me in silence. Then she spoke. She asked if I'd have accepted the same proposal from another woman. I said, "Naturally." Then out loud she asked herself if she loved me and, me, I said I had no idea. After another short silence she murmured that I was strange, very strange, and no doubt this was why she loved me, but that one day she might become disgusted with me for the same reason. I made no reply. Then she took me by the arm, smiled, and declared she would marry me after all. I said we could do it whenever she wanted to. (p. 69-70)</p>
            
            <h4>On the Bench of the Accused</h4>
            <p>Even on the bench of the accused, it's always interesting to hear yourself being talked about. During the arguments of the prosecutor and my attorney, I can say that there was a lot of talk about me, and maybe more talk about me than about my crime. Were they so different, in the end, the pleadings of my attorney and the arguments of the prosecutor? My lawyer raised his arms and pleaded guilty, but with extenuating circumstances. The prosecutor spread wide his hands and asserted guilty, no excuses. One thing however kind of bothered me. Despite my wandering thoughts, I was sometimes tempted to interrupt, which would cause my lawyer would say, "Keep quiet and it'll be much better for you." In some way, it was as if they were going to deal with the case completely apart from me. Everything happened without my involvement. My destiny was determined without anyone's asking me what I thought. From time to time I wanted to interrupt everything and say: "But all the same, who is the accused here? It's important to be the accused. And I have something to say." But on second thought, I really had nothing to say. (p. 151-152)</p>
            
            <h4>The Chaplain's Visit</h4>
            <p>"Why," he said to me, "do you refuse my visits?" I replied that I didn't believe in God. He wanted to know if I was sure about that, and I said I had never even wondered about it: to me the question seemed useless. Still sitting on the bed, he backed himself up against the wall, his hands resting on his thighs. As if I weren't even there, he observed that sometimes people thought they were certain about something, when in reality they weren't. I said nothing. He looked at me and asked, "What do you think?" I replied maybe so. In any case, I went on, maybe I wasn't certain about the things that truly interested me, but I was completely certain about the things that didn't interest me. And without a doubt what he wanted to talk about did not interest me.</p>
            <p>He looked away and, without changing position, asked if it wasn't hopelessness that was making me say these things. I told him I wasn't feeling hopeless. I felt only fear, which was perfectly natural in the circumstances. "In that case, God will help you," he remarked. "Everyone involved in your case has turned towards Him." I acknowledged that they had the right to. And they had the time for all that. As for me, I didn't want anyone to try to help me, and I certainly didn't have the time to concern myself with things that didn't interest me. (p. 176-177)</p>
            
            <h4>The End</h4>
            <p>For the first time in a long time, I thought about my mom. It seemed to me that I now understood why at the end of her life she'd taken on a "fianc&eacute;," why she'd tried to start all over. Just like here in my cell, over there at the retirement home where lives were extinguished one after the other, over there the evenings also felt like a truce&mdash;a sad truce, but a respite all the same. So close to death, my mom must have felt liberated and ready to start her life all over again. Nobody, not a person, had the right to cry over her. And I as well, I felt ready to start my life all over again. As if my anger had purged everything bad out of me, now hopeless, facing a night full of stars hinting at the future, for the first time I finally opened up to the tender indifference of the world. I detected the exact same indifference inside myself, and, somehow this led me to realize that I had always been happy, and was still happy. What would top it all off would be for me to feel less alone. For this reason, I hoped that there would be a lot of spectators at my execution and that they would greet me with howls and hatred. (p. 185-186)</p>

            <h3>George MacDonald Fraser: <em>Flashman and the Redskins</em></h3>
            <h4>From the "Explanatory Note"</h4>
            <p>As with [Flashman's] previous memoirs, I believe his truthfulness is not in question. As students of those volumes will be aware, his personal character was deplorable, his conduct abandoned, and his talent for mischief apparently inexaustible; indeed, his one redeeming feature was his unflinching veracity as a memorialist.</p>
            
            <h4>From the "The Forty-Niner" Chapter</h4>
            <p>It's a remarkable thing (and I've traded on it all my life) that a single redeeming quality in a black sheep wins greater esteem than all the virtues in honest men&mdash;espcially if the quality is courage. I'm lucky, because while I don't have it, I <em>look</em> as though I do, and worthy souls like [Kit] Carson and [Uncle Dick] Wooton never suspect that I'm running around with my bowels squirting, ready to decamp, squeal, or betray as occasion demands. And in their kindly ignorance, they give me a helping hand, as Carson had done&mdash;he'd also given me a damned nasty start for a moment; my nerves were still tingling.</p>
                <p>"Ah, well," says I, trying to sound hearty. "He's a good chap, is Uncle Dick."</p>
                <p>"Wah!" says [Carson], and had another consider to himself. "Safe home, then." A final pause. "If you chance back thisaway, give me a hollo."</p>
                <p>"I shan't be coming back," says I, and by George, I meant it.</p>
                <p>He nodded, lifted a hand slightly, and turned his pony down the trail. I watched him out of sight, the small buckskin figure fading into the trees, and while I felt nothing but relief at the time (for the Kit Carsons of this world and I don't ride easy together) what sticks in my mind now is how easy and natural it was to part and go your ways on the old frontier, without ceremony or farewell. It was almost a supersition, I suppose: no one ever said good-bye.(p. 260-261)</p>

            <h3>Leon Wieseltier: "Fouad" (<em>The New Republic</em>, July 14, 2014)</h3>
            <p>There is no more definitive demonstration of intellectual integrity than the willingness to offend your own congregation. The scandalizing of other congregations is easy, and rewards always accrue.</p>
            <h3>Adam Kirsch: "The Pseudo-Revolution" (<em>The New Republic</em>, May 12, 2014)</h3>
            <p>[There is a common] false analogy between the humanities and the sciences. Humanistic thinking does not proceed by experiments that yield results; it is a matter of mental experiences, provoked by works of art and history, that expand the range of one's understanding and sympathy.... It is precisely the experience of thought that constitutes the substance of a humanistic education.... This is why the best humanistic scholarship is creative, more akin to poetry and fiction than to chemistry or physics: it draws not just on a body of knowledge, though knowledge is indispensable, but on a scholar's imagination and sense of reality.... The human part of humanistic work ... is to feel and to think one's way into different times, places, and minds.</p>
            <h3>Leon Wieseltier: "An Ethical Stance" (<em>The New Republic</em>, Dec. 20, 2013 &amp; Jan. 6, 2014)</h3>
            <p>It is true that one cannot care equally about everything, that an ethical action is always concrete and therefore selective. But the ethical quality of one's action must be measured by one's standard for selection; and if that standard is not first and foremost determined by an impartial assessment of suffering and need, so that one selects as the beneficiaries of one's ethical energies not those who are most wretched but those whose wretchedness confirms one's prior ideological and political preferences, then the halo is a fake.</p>
            <h3>Steven Pinker: "Science Is Not Your Enemay" (<em>The New Republic</em>, Aug. 6, 2013)</h3>
            <p>Scientism, in this good sense, is not the belief that members of the occupational guild called “science” are particularly wise or noble. On the contrary, the defining practices of science, including open debate, peer review, and double-blind methods, are explicitly designed to circumvent the errors and sins to which scientists, being human, are vulnerable. Scientism does not mean that all current scientific hypotheses are true; most new ones are not, since the cycle of conjecture and refutation is the lifeblood of science. It is not an imperialistic drive to occupy the humanities; the promise of science is to enrich and diversify the intellectual tools of humanistic scholarship, not to obliterate them. And it is not the dogma that physical stuff is the only thing that exists. Scientists themselves are immersed in the ethereal medium of information, including the truths of mathematics, the logic of their theories, and the values that guide their enterprise. In this conception, science is of a piece with philosophy, reason, and Enlightenment humanism. It is distinguished by an explicit commitment to two ideals, and it is these that scientism seeks to export to the rest of intellectual life.</p>
            <p>The first is that the world is intelligible. The phenomena we experience may be explained by principles that are more general than the phenomena themselves. These principles may in turn be explained by more fundamental principles, and so on. In making sense of our world, there should be few occasions in which we are forced to concede “It just is” or “It’s magic” or “Because I said so.” The commitment to intelligibility is not a matter of brute faith, but gradually validates itself as more and more of the world becomes explicable in scientific terms. The processes of life, for example, used to be attributed to a mysterious élan vital; now we know they are powered by chemical and physical reactions among complex molecules. [...]</p>
            <p>The second ideal is that the acquisition of knowledge is hard. The world does not go out of its way to reveal its workings, and even if it did, our minds are prone to illusions, fallacies, and superstitions. Most of the traditional causes of belief—faith, revelation, dogma, authority, charisma, conventional wisdom, the invigorating glow of subjective certainty—are generators of error and should be dismissed as sources of knowledge. To understand the world, we must cultivate work-arounds for our cognitive limitations, including skepticism, open debate, formal precision, and empirical tests, often requiring feats of ingenuity. Any movement that calls itself “scientific” but fails to nurture opportunities for the falsification of its own beliefs (most obviously when it murders or imprisons the people who disagree with it) is not a scientific movement.</p>

            <p>And he thought, I shall go on blindly and secretly jumbling all these things together and making no sense of them as long as I live. Maybe every human creature carries some such inescapable burden. That is being human. A very weird affair. (p. 456)</p>

            <h3>Marcel Proust: <em>In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower</em> (aka <em>Within a Budding Grove</em>, translated by James Grieve)</h3>
            <h4>Fran&ccedil;oise</h4>
            <p>Since the day before, Fran&ccedil;oise, glad to be practicing the cook's art, for which she had a definite gift, inspired by the coming of a new guest, and knowing she was required to compose, in accordance with methods known only to herself, a dish of beef in aspic, had been living in a flurry of artistic creativity. Like Michelangelo spending eight months in the mountains of Carrara, selecting the  most perfect blocks of marble for the tomb of Pope Julius II, Fran&ccedil;oise, who attached extreme importance to the inherent qualify of the materials out of which her masterpieces were to be wrought, had been down to Les Halles in person more than once to choose the finest slabs of rump steak, the best shin of beef and calf's foot. [...] The day before, Fran&ccedil;oise had sent down to the oven of the local baker what she called "a Nev York ham," looking like pink marble inside its coating of breadcrumbs. In the belief that the language was poorer than it is, and her own ears less reliable than they were, the first time Fran&ccedil;oise had heard of "York ham," she must have deduced that the lexicon could not possibly be so abundant as to allow for both York and New York, that she had misheard, and that the right name was the one she already knew. Hence, ever since, the name of York was always preceded, for Fran&ccedil;oise's ears and eyes, by the word "New," which she pronounced "Nev." So it was with total sincerity that she would say to her scullery maid, "Go down to Olida's and get some ham. Ma'am particularly said she wants the Nev York." (p. 17-18)</p>
            <h4>La Berma</h4>
            <p>When our wish to be touched by nature or art is prompted by the hope of a grandiose revelation, we are loath to let it be replaced by lesser impressions, which might mislead us as to the true value of Beauty. La Berma in Racine's <em>Andromaque</em> or <em>Ph&egrave;dre</em>, in <em>Les Caprices de Marianne</em> by Musset, these were the stirring things that I had gloated on in imagination. I knew that if I could ever hear La Berma deliver the speech beginning</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">It is said, Sire, that a prompt departure must take you away, etc.</p>
            <p>my delight would be the same as when I could step out of a gondola, to stand in front of the Titian in the Frari or the Carpaccios in San Giorgio degli Schiavoni. My acquaintance with these lines of Racine's was in black and white, as mere print on the pages of books; but now my heart beat faster at the thought that I would soon see them in the warm, sunny flow shed on them by the Golden Voice. (p. 12-13)</p>
            <p>This first matinee was, alas, a great disappointment. [...] However hard I strained toward her with my eyes, ears, and mind, so as not to miss a single scrap of the incentives she would offer me to admire her, I could not manage to find any. I could not even perceive in her diction or use of movement, as I had with the other actesses, any sensitivity of tone or delicacy of gesture. I sat there and listened to her as I might have read <em>Ph&egrave;dre</em>, or as though at that moment Ph&egrave;dre herself was saying the things I was hearing, without La Berma's talent seeming to add anything at all to them. I wished I could arrest and hold motionless before me each of her intonations, freeeze each of the changing expressions on her face, so as to study them in depth and find out what was beautiful in them; at least I tried, by using all my mental ability, by having my whole attention at the ready and focused on a line just before its delivery, not to waste in preliminaries any iota of the time taken by each word or gesture, in the hope of being able, by sheer intensity of attention, to absorb each of them as I might have done if I had been able to hold them before me for hours on end. (p, 17; p. 20-21)</p>
            <p>After M. De Norpois's departure, my father glanced at the evening paper, while I sat thinking over my experience of La Berma. The pleasure I had taken in seeing her act was so far from the pleasure I had been looking forward to, and was in such acute need of sustenance, that it immediately assimilated whatever might nourish it, such as the qualities M. de Norpois had identified in her acting, which my mind had absorbed as easily as a parched meadow soaks up water. My father now handed me the newspaper, pointing to a review of the matinee: "[...] such an interpretation will stand not only as a landmark in our appreciation of the character of Ph&egrave;dre, one of the greatest and the most searching parts ever produced by Racine, but also as the finest, highest achievement in the realm of art that any of us have been privileged to witness in this day and age." This new concept of "the finest, highest achievement in the realm of art" had no sooner entered my mind than it located the imperfect enjoyment I had had at the theater, and added to it a little of what it lacked; this made such a heady mixture that I exclaimed, "What a great artiste she is!" (p. 53-54)</p>
            <h4>Killing his Love for Gilberte</h4>
            <p>Then, about the middle of January [...] I was assailed once more by the sorrow that had beset me before the holiday period. The cruelest thing in it was still that it was my own handiwork: that, actively and consciously, patiently and ruthlessly, I had brought it upon myself. The only thing I cared for, my relationship with Gilberte, was the very thing I was trying to sabotage, through my prolonging of our separation, through my gradual fostering not of her indifference toward me, but&mdash;which would come to the same thing in the end&mdash;of mine toward her. My unremitting effort was directed to bringing about the slow, agonizing suicide of the self that loved Gilberte; and this I did with a clear awareness both of my actions in the present and of the consequences of them for the future. (p. 186)</p>
            <h4>The Tall Girl by the Train</h4>
            <p>Looking at her, I was filled with that renewed longing for life which any fresh glipse of beauty and happiness can bring. Forgetting that beauty and happiness are only ever incarnated in an individual person, we replace them in our minds by a conventional pattern, a sort of average of all the different faces we have ever admired, all the different pleasures we have ever enjoyed, and thus carry about with us abstract images, which are lifeless and uninspiring because they lack the very quality that something new, something different from what is familiar, always possesses, and which is the quality inseparable from real beauty and happiness. So we make our pessimistic pronouncements on life, which we think are valid, in the belief that we have taken account of beauty and happiness, whereas we have actually omitted them from consideration, substituting for them synthetic compounds that contain nothing of them. (p. 234-235)</p>
