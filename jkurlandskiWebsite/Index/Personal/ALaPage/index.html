				<h3>What I've Been Reading</h3>
            </div>
        </br>
            <p>Here are some of the best, or at least some of the more interesting, things that I've been reading lately.</p>
            
            <h3>David Byrne, "Emergent Storytelling," and Our Search for Meaning in Others' Words</h3>
            <p>About two-thirds through David Byrne's <i>How Music Works</i>, he describes how he often goes about writing lyrics for songs. I was reminded of some of my other reading, on artificial dialog systems (as in chatbots).</p>
            <p>First, David Byrne:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">Writing words to fit an existing melody and meter, as I did on <i>Everything That Happens</i> and many other records, is something anyone who writes in rhyme does naturally and intuitively--every rapper improvises or composes to a meter, for example. I had been encouraged to make this process, which is usually internalized, more explicit when I was writing the words for <i>Remain in Light</i>. That was the first time I tackled a whole record of lyrics this way. I found that, remarkably, solving the puzzle of making words and phrases fit existing structures often resulted, somewhat surprisingly, in words that have an emotional consistency and sometimes even a narrative thread, even though those aspects of the texts weren't planned ahead of time.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">How does this happen? With <i>Remain in Light</i> and even before that, I would look for words that fit pre-existing melodic fragments that I or others had come up with. After filling lots of pages with non-sequitors, I would scan them to see if a lyrically resonant group emerged. Phrases that would hint at the beginning of an actual subject often seemed to <i>want</i> to emerge. This might seem magical--claiming a text "wants" to come into being (and we've heard this said before), but it's true. When some phrases, even if collected almost at random, begin to resonate together and appear to be talking about the same thing, it's tempting to claim they have a life of their own. The lyrics may have begun as gibberish, but often, though not always, a "story" in the broadest sense emerges. Emergent storytelling, one might say. (<i>How Music Works</i>, p. 198-199)</p>
            <p>With apologies to Mr. Byrne, what <i>I</i> think is happening when the phrases begin to "resonate together and appear to be talking about the same thing," is not so much the work of the phrases, but the operation of the human mind. In this case we are talking about the mind of the lyricist as well as the mind of the eventual listeners of the song. Below I've pasted the long passage which David Byrne's description reminded me of, but no doubt I could find something just as relevant in some of Grice's writings.</p>
            <p>From "A Robot in the Kitchen," by Peter Wallis (in which I've bold-faced the passages most relevant to my point):</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">Paul Seedhouse (Seedhouse, 2004) summarises the outcome of the last 50 years of CA (Conversation Analysis) research as with the observation that a conversational partner’s utterance will, in the normal case, go seen but unnoticed. That is, the utterance is an answer to a question, a response to a greeting or, more formally the second pair part of an adjacency pair. This is something computers can handle. A common occurrence is however where an utterance goes noticed and accounted for. In this case the conversational partner does not produce the expected response but what they do say makes sense. <b>Indeed the conversational partner will work hard to produce the accounting.</b> This is Eggins and Slade (Eggins and Slade, 1997) introducing sequential relevance:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="margin-left: 70px; line-height: 1">Consider, for example, the two turns at talk below:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="margin-left: 70px; line-height: 1">A: What’s that floating in the wine?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="margin-left: 70px; line-height: 1">B: There aren’t any other solutions.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="margin-left: 70px; line-height: 1">You will try very hard to find a way of interpreting B’s turn as somehow an answer to A’s question, even though there is no obvious link between them, apart from their appearance in sequence. Perhaps you will have decided that B took a common solution to a resistant wine cork and poked it through into the bottle, and it was floating in the wine. <b>Whatever explanation you came up with, it is unlikely that you looked at the example and simply said “it doesn’t make sense”, so strong is the implication that adjacent turns relate to each other.</b></p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">Having a machine account for human utterances is of course tricky but conversely the human conversational partner will work hard to account for what are actually machine failings.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">If you fail to account for your CP’s (Conversational Partner's) utterance, then your CP risks sanction. When your CP is a chat-bot, that sanction is likely, it seems, to take the form of swearing. As a classic example of a machine’s interaction eliciting sanctions, here is a conversation from the 1996 Lobner Competition:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: G’day mate.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: G’day. How’s it going?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: My mother once said ”How it is going is a mystery.” She was a bit nuts.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: Uh-huh.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: Are you still learning to speak, my friend?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: NO, no. But your anecdote took me a bit by surprise.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: How was your morning?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: Oh well, that’s a pity!</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: I’m sorry; what’s a pity?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: Apologies accepted.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: I feel compelled to insult you and we’ve only been talking a minute.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">SYSTEM: We are bloody well talking, aren’t we?</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">JUDGE: Oh baby. We sure are. So here are some keywords for you: shit mother baseball.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote" style="line-height: 1.3">This was the winning entry from that year but the point is not the system, but how the human responds. (Peter Wallis: "A Robot in the Kitchen," p. 29; bold-face mine)</p>

             <p>Again with apologies, here is a rough draft of "Once in a Lifetime," a song on the <i>Remain in Light</i> album, badly scanned by myself from David Byrne's book. His comment: "Judging by the fact that on this particular page there are actual stanzas and couplets, I suspect I was pretty far along in the process--earlier pages would have included anything, absolutely anything, that fit the meter and syllabic form, and might not have included any rhymes or be on a trajectory toward a subject." (p. 161-162)</p>

            <h3>Phillip Larkin's <em>Collected Poems</em></h3>
<pre class="prePoetry">
                The North Ship

        I saw three ships go sailing by,
        Over the sea, the lifting sea,
        And the wind rose in the morning sky,
        And one was rigged for a long journey.

        The first ship turned towards the west,
        Over the sea, the running sea,
        And by the wind was all possessed
        And carried to a rich country.

        The second ship turned towards the east,
        Over the sea, the quaking sea,
        And the wind hunted it like a beast
        To anchor in captivity.

        The third ship drove towards the north,
        Over the sea, the darkening sea,
        But no breath of wind came forth,
        And the decks shone frostily.

        The northern sky rose high and black
        Over the proud unfruitful sea,
        East and west the ships came back
        Happily or unhappily:

        But the third went wide and far
        Into an unforgiving sea
        Under a fire-spilling star,
        And it was rigged for a long journey.

                        Phillip Larkin

<pre class="prePoetry">
        The Siliconian came down like the wolf on the fold,
        And his cohorts were gleaming in wireless gold,
        Crying Media Company Vertically Integrated!
        As all before them they willfully extirpated:
        The Back of the Book and the Front and the Middle,
        Until all that was left was digital piddle,
        And Thought and Word lay dead and cold.
