			</div>
			<p>Here are some passages from great writing, or prescient thinking, that have stayed with me for years and years ... in reverse order of my first having encountered them.</p>
			

			<h3>Leon Wieseltier: "The Tolstoy Bailout" (<em>The New Republic</em>, March 18, 2009)</h3>
			<p>'In Tough Times, the Humanities Must Justify Their Worth." So The New York Times announced this week, in a report that made a grim country feel grimmer. "Previous economic downturns have often led to decreased enrollment in the disciplines loosely grouped under the term 'humanities'--which generally include languages, literature, the arts, history, cultural studies, philosophy, and religion. Many in the field worry that in this current crisis those areas will be hit hardest." The complaint against the humanities is that they are impractical. This is true. They will not change the world. They will change only the experience, and the understanding, and the evaluation, of the world. Since interpretation is the distinctively human activity, instruction in the traditions of interpretation should hardly be controversial--except in a society that mistakes practice for a philosophy. It is worth remembering, then, that the crisis in which we find ourselves was the work of practical men. The securitization of mortgages was not conceived by a head in the clouds. No poet cost anybody their house. No historian cost anybody their job. Not even the most pampered of professors ever squandered $87,000 of someone else's money on a little rug. The creativity of bankers is a luxury that we can no longer afford. [...] Regression  analysis will not get us through the long night. We need to know more about the human heart than the study of consumer behavior can  teach. These are the hours when the old Penguin paperbacks must stand us in good stead. It was for now that we read them then.</p>

			<h3>Iris Murdoch: Swimming in the Thames by Night (<em>Under the Net</em>)</h3>
			<p>We looked at each other and smiled in the darkness. He turned to the river and began edging awkwardly down, his body diminishing into the black water. The night air touched my body with a touch which was neither warm nor cold, only very soft and unexpected. My blood buzzed behind my skin with a nervous beat. Then without a sound Lefty had followed Finn. The water took my ankles in a cold clasp. As I went down I could see from the corner of my eye Dave crouched above me like a monument. Then the water was about my neck and I shot out into the open river.</p>
			<p>The sky opened out above me like an unfurled banner, cascading with stars and blanched by the moon. The black hulls of barges darkened the water behind me and murky towers and pinnacles rose indistinctly on the other bank. I swam well out into the river. It seemed enormously wide; and as I looked up and down stream I could see on one side the dark pools under Blackfriars Bridge, and on the other the pillars of Southwark Bridge glistening under the moon. The whole expanse of water was running with light. It was like swimming in quicksilver. I looked about for Finn and Lefty, and soon saw their heads bobbing not far away. They came towards me and for a while we swam together. We had caught the tide beautifully upon the turn and there was not the least hint of a current.</p>
			<p>I was easily the best swimmer of the three. Finn swims strongly but awkwardly, wasting his power in unnecessary movements and rolling too much from side to side. Lefty swam with neatness but without vigour. I guessed that he would soon tire. I swim excellently, giving myself to the water, and I have an effortless crawl which I can keep up indefinitely. Swimming has natural affinities with Judo. Both arts depend up one's willingness to surrender a rigid and nervous attachment to the upright position. Both bring muscles into play throughout the whole body. Both demand, over an exceptionally wide area of bodily activity, the elimination of superfluous motion. Both resemble the dynamism of water which runs through many channels to find its own level. In fact, however, once one has learnt to control one's body and overcome the primeval fear of falling which is so deep in the human consciousness, there are few physical arts and graces which are not thereby laid open to one, or at any rate made much easier of access. I am, for instance, a good dancer and a very creditable tennis player. If it were possible for anything to console me for my lack of height, these things would console me.</p>
			<p>Now the other two had gone back to the step. I swam to one of the barges, and clung on to the cable for a while, throwing my head back to scan a panorama of blue-black sky and black and silver water, and stilling my body until the silence entered me with a rush... (p. 106-107)</p>

			<h3>The Amis's, P&egrave;re and Fils, on the Hangover (and the lack thereof)</h3>
			<h4>Kingsley Amis, <em>Lucky Jim</em></h4>
			<p>Dixon was alive again. Consciousness was upon him before he could get out of the way; not for him the slow, gracious wandering from the halls of sleep, but a summary, forcible ejection. He lay sparawled, too wicked to move, spewed up like a broken spider-crab on the tarry shingle of the morning. The light did him harm, but not as much as looking at things did; he resolved, having done it once, never to move his eyeballs again. A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse. His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he'd somehow been on a cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police. He felt bad. (p. 60)</p>
			<h4>Martin Amis, <em>Money</em></h4>
			<p>Having used the bathroom, and sparingly, I sauntered naked down the stairs. [...] I sat on the sofa and massaged my face. I felt strange--uncoupled, uncanny. For a good few minutes I thought I must be seriously ill, unprecedentedly, terminally so. My symptoms included a spectral clarity of vision, numbness of head and springiness of limb, and a weird watery taste in the root of my mouth. Whoops, here it comes, I thought, the lung thing, the heart deal, the brain gimmick. Then I realised what was up. No hangover. So this is what morning is. It's not unprecedented. I remember now. (p. 289)</p>

			<h3>Martin Amis, <em>Money</em></h3>
			<h4>John Self and Selina</h4>
			<p>'I've just gone off sex,' said Selina this morning, as she finished the tea I'd fondly brought her.</p>
			<p>'So?' I asked her.</p>
			<p>'God, <em>be nice</em>. Use your imagination. It'll pass. I've just gone off sex.'</p>
			<p><em>Then what do you think is the</em> point <em>of you?</em> I wanted to say. But I didn't. I resisted the temptation. I looked into the proud drama of her face, the valves and orbits of her throat, the wetlook runnels of her hair, the breasts, heavier than ever, solidly mounted on the ribcage, the naked slopes of the belly, the sudden flaring of the hips, a smell of sleep.</p>
			<p>'Then what do you think is the <em>point</em> of you?'</p>
			<p>'You,' she said, 'are unreal.' (p. 226)</p>
			<br/>
			<h4>John Self and Martina</h4>
			<p>Oh me, my alas and alack. Oh crappy day. What a scream, eh, what a riot? Life is a wag and a funster. Life is the life of the party. It <em>scintillates</em>. I've heard this joke before, of course. It <em>is</em> an old one. I've had my share of bonk-famines, no-shows and squidge-gimmicks, shoe-horners and sneeze-jobs, twang-strikes and heft-outs. But I've never heard the joke in its long version, in its serial form. I could raise my rope for Butch Beausoleil. I could raise my rope for Selina Street and a snob of a whore on Third Avenue. This old rope of mine has seen action with all shapes and sizes, with the good and the bad and the ugly. But I can't raise my rope for Martina Twain, no sir. It seems she just isn't good enough for this old rope of mine.</p>
			<p>'It doesn't matter,' she said last night, for the twentieth time. I lay there, a sixteen-stone teardrop, blinking, smarting, all made of salt. 'Oh yeah?' I croaked. She embraced me and in her hot whisper she said everything that was humanly sayable. 'Oh yeah?' I croaked again. I can't even make it as an animal any more. Even as an animal I'm all washed up. 'Jesus,' I said. 'What do I think is the <em>point</em> of me?' (p. 298-299)</p>

			<h3>Rabelais: "How Gargantua the Giant Gave Paris its Name" (<em>Gargantua and Pantagruel, Book 1</em>, translated by J. M. Cohen)</h3>
			<p>Some days after they had finished their refreshment, Gargantua went to see the sights of the town, and everyone stared at him in great wonder. For the Parisians are such simpletons, such gapers, and such feckless idiots that a buffoon, a pedlar of indulgences, a mule with bells on its colllar, or a fiddler at a crossroad will draw a greater crowd than a good preacher of the Gospel.</p>
			<p>The people so pestered him, in fact, that he was compelled to take a rest on the towers of Notre-Dame; and when from there he saw so many, pressing all around him, he said in a clear voice:</p>
			<p>'I think these clodhoppers want me to pay for my kind reception and offer them a <em>solarium</em>. They are quite justified, and I am going to give them some wine, to buy my welcome. But only in sport, <em>par ris</em>.'</p>
			<p>Then, with a smile, he undid his magnificent codpiece and, bringing out his john-thomas, pissed on them so fiercely that he drowned two hundred and sixty thousand, four hundred and eighteen persons, not counting the women and small children.</p>
			<p>A number of them, however, were quick enough on their feet to escape this piss-flood: and when they reached the top of the hill above the University, sweating, coughing, spitting, and out of breath, they began to swear and curse, some in a fury and others in sport (<em>par ris</em>). 'Carymary, Carymara! My holy tart, we've been drenched in sport! We've been drenched <em>par ris</em>.'</p>
			<p>Hence it was that the city was ever afterwards called Paris. (from Ch. 17)</p>

			<h3>Karl Popper: Definition of Rationalism (<em>The Open Society and Its Enemies, Pt. 2</em>)</h3>
			<p>We could then say that rationalism is an attitude of readiness to listen to critical arguments and to learn from experience. It is fundamentally an attitude of admitting that '<em>I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth</em>'. It is an attitude which does not lightly give up hope that by such means as argument and careful observation, people may reach some kind of agreement on many problems of importance; and that, even where their demands and their interests clash, it is often possible to argue about the various demands and proposals, and to reach--perhaps by arbitration--a compromise which, because of its equity, is acceptable to most, if not to all. In short, the rationalist attitude, or, as I may perhaps label it, the 'attitude of reasonableness', is very similar to the scientific attitude, to the belief that in the search for truth we need co-operation, and that, with the help of argument, we can in time attain something like objectivity (p. 225).</p>

			<h3>John Irving: On American Literature (<em>The Hotel New Hampshire</em>)</h3>
			<p>"You know," Fehlgeburt would tell me, "the single ingredient in American literature that distinguishes it from other literatures of the world is a kind of giddy, illogical hopefulness. It is quite technically sophisticated while remaining ideologically naive." (Ch. 9, p. 277)</p>
			<p><em>And, I'll add, that can especially be said of American cinema. And for</em> ideologically <em>we can substitute other words, such as</em> psychologically. <em>The result is something like:</em> The single ingredient in American cinema that distinguishes it from other cinemas of the world is a kind of giddly, illogical hopefulness. It is quite technically sophisticated while remaining psychologicaly naive."</p>

			<h3>Marvin Mudrick: Maybe Over No, Yes Over Maybe (<em>Nobody Here But Us Chickens</em>)</h3>
			<p>I write about the [historical and fictional] people in this book from the angle (with the bias) of certain at least theoretical choices of my own: either over neither, both over either/or, live-and-let-live over stand-or-die, high spirits over low, energy over apathy, wit over dullness, jokes over homilies, good humor over jokes, good nature over bad, feeling over sentiment, truth over poetry, consciousness over explanations, tragedy over pathos, comedy over tragedy, entertainment over art, private over public, generosity over meanness, charity over murder, love over charity, irreplaceable over interchangeable, divergence over concurrence, principle over interest, people over principle. (from the Preface)</p>

            <h3>Mark Twain: <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em></h3>
            <p>Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.</p>
            <p>Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p>
            <p>"Hello, Huckleberry!"</p>
            <p>"Hello yourself, and see how you like it."</p>
            <p>"What's that you got?"</p>
            <p>"Dead cat."</p>
            <p>"Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him?"</p>
            <p>"Bought him off'n a boy."</p>
            <p>"What did you give?"</p>
            <p>"I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house."</p>
