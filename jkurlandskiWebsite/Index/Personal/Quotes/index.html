			<p>Here are some passages from great writing, or prescient thinking, that have stayed with me for years and years ... in reverse order of my first having encountered them.</p>


			<h3>Leon Wieseltier: "The Tolstoy Bailout" (<em>The New Republic</em>, March 18, 2009)</h3>
			<p class="indentedQuote">'In Tough Times, the Humanities Must Justify Their Worth." So The New York Times announced this week, in a report that made a grim country feel grimmer. "Previous economic downturns have often led to decreased enrollment in the disciplines loosely grouped under the term 'humanities'&mdash;which generally include languages, literature, the arts, history, cultural studies, philosophy, and religion. Many in the field worry that in this current crisis those areas will be hit hardest." The complaint against the humanities is that they are impractical. This is true. They will not change the world. They will change only the experience, and the understanding, and the evaluation, of the world. Since interpretation is the distinctively human activity, instruction in the traditions of interpretation should hardly be controversial&mdash;except in a society that mistakes practice for a philosophy. It is worth remembering, then, that the crisis in which we find ourselves was the work of practical men. The securitization of mortgages was not conceived by a head in the clouds. No poet cost anybody their house. No historian cost anybody their job. Not even the most pampered of professors ever squandered $87,000 of someone else's money on a little rug. The creativity of bankers is a luxury that we can no longer afford. [...] Regression  analysis will not get us through the long night. We need to know more about the human heart than the study of consumer behavior can  teach. These are the hours when the old Penguin paperbacks must stand us in good stead. It was for now that we read them then.</p>
        <br/>

			<h3>Iris Murdoch: Swimming in the Thames by Night (<em>Under the Net</em>)</h3>
			<p class="indentedQuote">We looked at each other and smiled in the darkness. He turned to the river and began edging awkwardly down, his body diminishing into the black water. The night air touched my body with a touch which was neither warm nor cold, only very soft and unexpected. My blood buzzed behind my skin with a nervous beat. Then without a sound Lefty had followed Finn. The water took my ankles in a cold clasp. As I went down I could see from the corner of my eye Dave crouched above me like a monument. Then the water was about my neck and I shot out into the open river.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">The sky opened out above me like an unfurled banner, cascading with stars and blanched by the moon. The black hulls of barges darkened the water behind me and murky towers and pinnacles rose indistinctly on the other bank. I swam well out into the river. It seemed enormously wide; and as I looked up and down stream I could see on one side the dark pools under Blackfriars Bridge, and on the other the pillars of Southwark Bridge glistening under the moon. The whole expanse of water was running with light. It was like swimming in quicksilver. I looked about for Finn and Lefty, and soon saw their heads bobbing not far away. They came towards me and for a while we swam together. We had caught the tide beautifully upon the turn and there was not the least hint of a current.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">I was easily the best swimmer of the three. Finn swims strongly but awkwardly, wasting his power in unnecessary movements and rolling too much from side to side. Lefty swam with neatness but without vigour. I guessed that he would soon tire. I swim excellently, giving myself to the water, and I have an effortless crawl which I can keep up indefinitely. Swimming has natural affinities with Judo. Both arts depend up one's willingness to surrender a rigid and nervous attachment to the upright position. Both bring muscles into play throughout the whole body. Both demand, over an exceptionally wide area of bodily activity, the elimination of superfluous motion. Both resemble the dynamism of water which runs through many channels to find its own level. In fact, however, once one has learnt to control one's body and overcome the primeval fear of falling which is so deep in the human consciousness, there are few physical arts and graces which are not thereby laid open to one, or at any rate made much easier of access. I am, for instance, a good dancer and a very creditable tennis player. If it were possible for anything to console me for my lack of height, these things would console me.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Now the other two had gone back to the step. I swam to one of the barges, and clung on to the cable for a while, throwing my head back to scan a panorama of blue-black sky and black and silver water, and stilling my body until the silence entered me with a rush... (p. 106-107)</p>
        <br/>

			<h3>Primo Levi: "Carbon" (<em>The Periodic Table</em>, translated by Raymond Rosenthal)</h3>
			<p class="indentedQuote">The reader, at this point, will have realized for some time now that this is not a chemical treatise: my presumption does not reach so far&mdash;"<em>ma voix est foible, et m&ecirc;me un peu profane</em>." Nor is it an autobiography, save in the partial and symbolic limits in which every piece of writing is autobiographical, indeed every human work; but it is in some fashion a history.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">It is&mdash;or would have liked to be&mdash;a micro-history, the history of a trade and its defeats, victories, and miseries, such as everyone wants to tell when he feels close to concluding the arc of his career, and art ceases to be long. Having reached this point in life, what chemist, facing the Periodic Table, or the monumental indices of Beilstien or Landolt, does not percieve scattered among them the sad tatters, or trophies, of his own professional past? He only has to leaf through any treatise and memories rise up in bunches: there is among us he who has tied his destiny, indelibly, to bromine or to propylene, or the -NCO group, or glutamine acid; and every chemistry student, faced by almost any treatise, should be aware that on one of those pages, perhaps in a single line, formula, or word, his future is written in indecipherable characters, which, however, will become clear "afterward": after sucess, error, or guilt, victory or defeat. Every no longer young chemist, turning again to the <em>verh&auml;ngnisvoll</em> page in that same treatise, is struck again by love or disgust, delights or despairs.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">So it happens, therefore, that every element says something to someone (something different to each) like the mountain valleys or beaches visited in youth. One must perhaps make an execption for carbon, because it says everything to everyone, that is, it is not specific, in the same way that Adam is not specific as an ancestor&mdash;unless one discovers today (why not?) the chemist-stylite who has dedicated his life to graphite or the diamond. And yet it is exactly to this carbon that I have an old debt, contracted during what for me were decisive days. To carbon, the element of life, my first literary dream was turned, insistently dreamed in an hour and a place when my life was not worth much: yes, I wanted to tell the story of an atom of carbon.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Is it right to speak of a "particular" atom of carbon? For the chemist there exist some doubts, because until 1970 he did not have the techniques permitting him to see, or in any event isolate, a single atom; no doubts exist for the narrator, who therefore sets out to narrate.</p>
        <br/>

			<h3> P. G. Wodehouse: <em> Right Ho, Jeeves</em></h3>
			<p class="indentedQuote">It is not too much to say that I was piqued to the tonsils.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">I mean to say, one does not court praise. The adulation of the multitude means very little to one. But, all the same, when one has taken the trouble to whack out a highly juicy scheme to benefit an in-the-soup friend in his hour of travail, it's pretty foul to find him giving the credit to one's personal attendant, particularly if that personal attendant is a man who goes about the place not packing mess-jackets.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">But after I had been splashing about in the porcelain for a bit, composure began to return. I have always found that in moments of heart-bowed-downness there is nothing that calms the bruised spirit like a good go at the soap and water. I don't say I actually sang in the tub, but there were times when it was a mere spin of the coin whether I would do so or not.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">The spiritual anguish induced by that tactless speech had become noticeably lessened.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">The discovery of a toy duck in the soap dish, presumably the property of some former juvenile visitor, contributed not a little to this new and happier frame of mind. What with one thing and another, I hadn't played with toy ducks in my bath for years, and I found the novel experience most invigorating. For the benefit of those interested, I may mention that if you shove the thing under the surface with the sponge and then let it go, it shoots out of the water in a manner calculated to divert the most careworn. Ten minutes of this and I was enabled to return to the bedchamber much more the old merry Bertram.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Jeeves was there, laying out the dinner disguise. He greeted the young master with his customary suavity. (Chapter 9)</p>
        <br/>

			<h3>The Amis's, P&egrave;re and Fils, on the Hangover (and the lack thereof)</h3>
			<h4>Kingsley Amis, <em>Lucky Jim</em></h4>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Dixon was alive again. Consciousness was upon him before he could get out of the way; not for him the slow, gracious wandering from the halls of sleep, but a summary, forcible ejection. He lay sparawled, too wicked to move, spewed up like a broken spider-crab on the tarry shingle of the morning. The light did him harm, but not as much as looking at things did; he resolved, having done it once, never to move his eyeballs again. A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse. His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he'd somehow been on a cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police. He felt bad. (p. 60)</p>
			<h4>Martin Amis, <em>Money</em></h4>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Having used the bathroom, and sparingly, I sauntered naked down the stairs. [...] I sat on the sofa and massaged my face. I felt strange&mdash;uncoupled, uncanny. For a good few minutes I thought I must be seriously ill, unprecedentedly, terminally so. My symptoms included a spectral clarity of vision, numbness of head and springiness of limb, and a weird watery taste in the root of my mouth. Whoops, here it comes, I thought, the lung thing, the heart deal, the brain gimmick. Then I realised what was up. No hangover. So this is what morning is. It's not unprecedented. I remember now. (p. 289)</p>
        <br/>

			<h3>Martin Amis, <em>Money</em></h3>
			<h4>John Self and Selina</h4>
			<p class="indentedQuote">'I've just gone off sex,' said Selina this morning, as she finished the tea I'd fondly brought her.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">'So?' I asked her.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">'God, <em>be nice</em>. Use your imagination. It'll pass. I've just gone off sex.'</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote"><em>Then what do you think is the</em> point <em>of you?</em> I wanted to say. But I didn't. I resisted the temptation. I looked into the proud drama of her face, the valves and orbits of her throat, the wetlook runnels of her hair, the breasts, heavier than ever, solidly mounted on the ribcage, the naked slopes of the belly, the sudden flaring of the hips, a smell of sleep.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">'Then what do you think is the <em>point</em> of you?'</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">'You,' she said, 'are unreal.' (p. 226)</p>
			<br/>
			<h4>John Self and Martina</h4>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Oh me, my alas and alack. Oh crappy day. What a scream, eh, what a riot? Life is a wag and a funster. Life is the life of the party. It <em>scintillates</em>. I've heard this joke before, of course. It <em>is</em> an old one. I've had my share of bonk-famines, no-shows and squidge-gimmicks, shoe-horners and sneeze-jobs, twang-strikes and heft-outs. But I've never heard the joke in its long version, in its serial form. I could raise my rope for Butch Beausoleil. I could raise my rope for Selina Street and a snob of a whore on Third Avenue. This old rope of mine has seen action with all shapes and sizes, with the good and the bad and the ugly. But I can't raise my rope for Martina Twain, no sir. It seems she just isn't good enough for this old rope of mine.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">'It doesn't matter,' she said last night, for the twentieth time. I lay there, a sixteen-stone teardrop, blinking, smarting, all made of salt. 'Oh yeah?' I croaked. She embraced me and in her hot whisper she said everything that was humanly sayable. 'Oh yeah?' I croaked again. I can't even make it as an animal any more. Even as an animal I'm all washed up. 'Jesus,' I said. 'What do I think is the <em>point</em> of me?' (p. 298-299)</p>
        <br/>

			<h3>Rabelais: "How Gargantua the Giant Gave Paris its Name" (<em>Gargantua and Pantagruel, Book 1</em>, translated by J. M. Cohen)</h3>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Some days after they had finished their refreshment, Gargantua went to see the sights of the town, and everyone stared at him in great wonder. For the Parisians are such simpletons, such gapers, and such feckless idiots that a buffoon, a pedlar of indulgences, a mule with bells on its colllar, or a fiddler at a crossroad will draw a greater crowd than a good preacher of the Gospel.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">The people so pestered him, in fact, that he was compelled to take a rest on the towers of Notre-Dame; and when from there he saw so many, pressing all around him, he said in a clear voice:</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">'I think these clodhoppers want me to pay for my kind reception and offer them a <em>solarium</em>. They are quite justified, and I am going to give them some wine, to buy my welcome. But only in sport, <em>par ris</em>.'</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Then, with a smile, he undid his magnificent codpiece and, bringing out his john-thomas, pissed on them so fiercely that he drowned two hundred and sixty thousand, four hundred and eighteen persons, not counting the women and small children.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">A number of them, however, were quick enough on their feet to escape this piss-flood: and when they reached the top of the hill above the University, sweating, coughing, spitting, and out of breath, they began to swear and curse, some in a fury and others in sport (<em>par ris</em>). 'Carymary, Carymara! My holy tart, we've been drenched in sport! We've been drenched <em>par ris</em>.'</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Hence it was that the city was ever afterwards called Paris. (from Ch. 17)</p>
        <br/>

			<h3>Karl Popper: Definition of Rationalism (<em>The Open Society and Its Enemies, Pt. 2</em>)</h3>
			<p class="indentedQuote">We could then say that rationalism is an attitude of readiness to listen to critical arguments and to learn from experience. It is fundamentally an attitude of admitting that '<em>I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth</em>'. It is an attitude which does not lightly give up hope that by such means as argument and careful observation, people may reach some kind of agreement on many problems of importance; and that, even where their demands and their interests clash, it is often possible to argue about the various demands and proposals, and to reach&mdash;perhaps by arbitration&mdash;a compromise which, because of its equity, is acceptable to most, if not to all. In short, the rationalist attitude, or, as I may perhaps label it, the 'attitude of reasonableness', is very similar to the scientific attitude, to the belief that in the search for truth we need co-operation, and that, with the help of argument, we can in time attain something like objectivity (p. 225).</p>
        <br/>

			<h3>John Irving: On American Literature (<em>The Hotel New Hampshire</em>)</h3>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"You know," Fehlgeburt would tell me, "the single ingredient in American literature that distinguishes it from other literatures of the world is a kind of giddy, illogical hopefulness. It is quite technically sophisticated while remaining ideologically naive." (Ch. 9, p. 277)</p>
			<p><em>And, I'll add, that can especially be said of American cinema. And for</em> ideologically <em>we can substitute other words, such as</em> psychologically. <em>The result is something like:</em> "The single ingredient in American cinema that distinguishes it from other cinemas of the world is a kind of giddly, illogical hopefulness. It is quite technically sophisticated while remaining psychologically naive."</p>
        <br/>

			<h3>Marvin Mudrick: Maybe Over No, Yes Over Maybe (<em>Nobody Here But Us Chickens</em>)</h3>
			<p class="indentedQuote">I write about the [historical and fictional] people in this book from the angle (with the bias) of certain at least theoretical choices of my own: either over neither, both over either/or, live-and-let-live over stand-or-die, high spirits over low, energy over apathy, wit over dullness, jokes over homilies, good humor over jokes, good nature over bad, feeling over sentiment, truth over poetry, consciousness over explanations, tragedy over pathos, comedy over tragedy, entertainment over art, private over public, generosity over meanness, charity over murder, love over charity, irreplaceable over interchangeable, divergence over concurrence, principle over interest, people over principle. (from the Preface)</p>
        <br/>

			<h3>Alfred Hitchcock: "Ahem! If I May Have a Moment" (Introduction to <em>Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Stories that Scared Even Me</em>)</h3>
			<p class="indentedQuote">I hope no one will construe the title of this tome as a challenge. It is&mdash;in case you were so eager to get to the stories that you didn't notice&mdash;<em>Stories that Scared Even Me</em>. This is meant as a simple statement of fact, not as a summons for you to cry in ringing tones that some of the stories didn't scare you. Why the word <em>Even</em> is in there I don't know. I proposed to call the book, in a simple and dignified manner, <em>Stories that Scared Me</em>. I was overruled. It seems that <em>Stories that Scared Even Me</em> has more swing to it. And this is, obviously, the day of the swinger.</p>

<pre class="prePoetry">
		Conscientious Objector

	I shall die, but
	that is all that I shall do for Death.
	I hear him leading his horse out of the stall;
	I hear the clatter on the barn-floor.
	He is in haste; he has business in Cuba,
	business in the Balkans, many calls to make this morning.
	But I will not hold the bridle
	while he clinches the girth.
	And he may mount by himself:
	I will not give him a leg up.

	Though he flick my shoulders with his whip,
	I will not tell him which way the fox ran.
	With his hoof on my breast, I will not tell him where
	the black boy hides in the swamp.
	I shall die, but that is all that I shall do for Death;
	I am not on his pay-roll.

	I will not tell him the whereabout of my friends
	nor of my enemies either.
	Though he promise me much,
	I will not map him the route to any man's door.
	Am I a spy in the land of the living,
	that I should deliver men to Death?
	Brother, the password and the plans of our city
	are safe with me; never through me Shall you be overcome.

            <h3>Mark Twain: <em>The Mysterious Stranger</em></h3>
            <h4>The World in Miniature</h4>
			<p class="indentedQuote">He ate nothing himself, but sat and chatted, and did one curious thing after another to amuse us. He made a tiny toy squirrel out of clay, and it ran up a tree and sat on a limb overhead and barked down at us. Then he made a dog that was not much larger than a mouse, and it treed the squirrel and danced about the tree, excited and barking, and was as alive as any dog could be. It frightened the squirrel from tree to tree and followed it up until both were out of sight in the forest. He made birds out of clay and set them free, and they flew away, singing.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">At last I made bold to ask him to tell us who he was.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"An angel," he said, quite simply, and set another bird free and clapped his hands and made it fly away.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">A kind of awe fell upon us when we heard him say that, and we were afraid again; but he said we need not be troubled, there was no occasion for us to be afraid of an angel, and he liked us, anyway. He went on chatting as simply and unaffectedly as ever; and while he talked he made a crowd of little men and women the size of your finger, and they went diligently to work and cleared and leveled off a space a couple of yards square in the grass and began to build a cunning little castle in it, the women mixing the mortar and carrying it up the scaffoldings in pails on their heads, just as our work-women have always done, and the men laying the courses of masonry—five hundred of these toy people swarming briskly about and working diligently and wiping the sweat off their faces as natural as life. In the absorbing interest of watching those five hundred little people make the castle grow step by step and course by course, and take shape and symmetry, that feeling and awe soon passed away and we were quite comfortable and at home again. We asked if we might make some people, and he said yes, and told Seppi to make some cannon for the walls, and told Nikolaus to make some halberdiers, with breastplates and greaves and helmets, and I was to make some cavalry, with horses, and in allotting these tasks he called us by our names, but did not say how he knew them. Then Seppi asked him what his own name was, and he said, tranquilly, "Satan," and held out a chip and caught a little woman on it who was falling from the scaffolding and put her back where she belonged, and said, "She is an idiot to step backward like that and not notice what she is about."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">It caught us suddenly, that name did, and our work dropped out of our hands and broke to pieces—a cannon, a halberdier, and a horse. Satan laughed, and asked what was the matter. I said, "Nothing, only it seemed a strange name for an angel." He asked why.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"Because it's—it's—well, it's his name, you know."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"Yes—he is my uncle."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">He said it placidly, but it took our breath for a moment and made our hearts beat. He did not seem to notice that, but mended our halberdiers and things with a touch, handing them to us finished, and said, "Don't you remember?—he was an angel himself, once."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"Yes—it's true," said Seppi; "I didn't think of that."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"Before the Fall he was blameless."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"Yes," said Nikolaus, "he was without sin."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"It is a good family—ours," said Satan; "there is not a better. He is the only member of it that has ever sinned."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">I should not be able to make any one understand how exciting it all was. You know that kind of quiver that trembles around through you when you are seeing something so strange and enchanting and wonderful that it is just a fearful joy to be alive and look at it; and you know how you gaze, and your lips turn dry and your breath comes short, but you wouldn't be anywhere but there, not for the world. I was bursting to ask one question—I had it on my tongue's end and could hardly hold it back—but I was ashamed to ask it; it might be a rudeness. Satan set an ox down that he had been making, and smiled up at me and said:</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"It wouldn't be a rudeness, and I should forgive it if it was. Have I seen him? Millions of times. From the time that I was a little child a thousand years old I was his second favorite among the nursery angels of our blood and lineage—to use a human phrase—yes, from that time until the Fall, eight thousand years, measured as you count time."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"Eight—thousand!"</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">"Yes." He turned to Seppi, and went on as if answering something that was in Seppi's mind: "Why, naturally I look like a boy, for that is what I am. With us what you call time is a spacious thing; it takes a long stretch of it to grow an angel to full age." There was a question in my mind, and he turned to me and answered it, "I am sixteen thousand years old—counting as you count." Then he turned to Nikolaus and said: "No, the Fall did not affect me nor the rest of the relationship. It was only he that I was named for who ate of the fruit of the tree and then beguiled the man and the woman with it. We others are still ignorant of sin; we are not able to commit it; we are without blemish, and shall abide in that estate always. We—" Two of the little workmen were quarreling, and in buzzing little bumblebee voices they were cursing and swearing at each other; now came blows and blood; then they locked themselves together in a life-and-death struggle. Satan reached out his hand and crushed the life out of them with his fingers, threw them away, wiped the red from his fingers on his handkerchief, and went on talking where he had left off: "We cannot do wrong; neither have we any disposition to do it, for we do not know what it is."</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">It seemed a strange speech, in the circumstances, but we barely noticed that, we were so shocked and grieved at the wanton murder he had committed—for murder it was, that was its true name, and it was without palliation or excuse, for the men had not wronged him in any way. It made us miserable, for we loved him, and had thought him so noble and so beautiful and gracious, and had honestly believed he was an angel; and to have him do this cruel thing—ah, it lowered him so, and we had had such pride in him. He went right on talking, just as if nothing had happened, telling about his travels, and the interesting things he had seen in the big worlds of our solar system and of other solar systems far away in the remotenesses of space, and about the customs of the immortals that inhabit them, somehow fascinating us, enchanting us, charming us in spite of the pitiful scene that was now under our eyes, for the wives of the little dead men had found the crushed and shapeless bodies and were crying over them, and sobbing and lamenting, and a priest was kneeling there with his hands crossed upon his breast, praying; and crowds and crowds of pitying friends were massed about them, reverently uncovered, with their bare heads bowed, and many with the tears running down—a scene which Satan paid no attention to until the small noise of the weeping and praying began to annoy him, then he reached out and took the heavy board seat out of our swing and brought it down and mashed all those people into the earth just as if they had been flies, and went on talking just the same. An angel, and kill a priest! An angel who did not know how to do wrong, and yet destroys in cold blood hundreds of helpless poor men and women who had never done him any harm! It made us sick to see that awful deed, and to think that none of those poor creatures was prepared except the priest, for none of them had ever heard a mass or seen a church. And we were witnesses; we had seen these murders done and it was our duty to tell, and let the law take its course.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">But he went on talking right along, and worked his enchantments upon us again with that fatal music of his voice. He made us forget everything; we could only listen to him, and love him, and be his slaves, to do with us as he would. He made us drunk with the joy of being with him, and of looking into the heaven of his eyes, and of feeling the ecstasy that thrilled along our veins from the touch of his hand. (From Chapter 2)</p>

            <h3>Mark Twain: <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em></h3>
            <h4>Joining Satan in Hell</h4>
            <p class="indentedQuote">So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn't know what to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I'll go and write the letter—and then see if I can pray.  Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone.  So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote:</p>
            <p class="doubleIndentedQuote">Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send. <em>Huck Finn.</em></p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now.  But I didn't do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking—thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell.  And went on thinking.  And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time:  in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing.  But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind.  I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, 'stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the <em>only</em> one he's got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">"All right, then, I'll <em>go</em> to hell"—and tore it up.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said.  And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.  I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn't.  And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog. (From Ch. XXXI)</p>

            <h3>Mark Twain: <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em></h3>
            <h4>Huckleberry's Footwear</h4>
            <p class="indentedQuote">Huckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to school or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it suited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he pleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor put on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything that goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed, hampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">Tom hailed the romantic outcast:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">"Hello, Huckleberry!"</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">"Hello yourself, and see how you like it."</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">"What's that you got?"</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">"Dead cat."</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">"Lemme see him, Huck. My, he's pretty stiff. Where'd you get him?"</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">"Bought him off'n a boy."</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">"What did you give?"</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">"I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house." (From Chapter VI)</p>
