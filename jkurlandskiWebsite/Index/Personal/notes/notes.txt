In progress:

√ Get intro from old home page--adventures--and put on Families page--new home page for Adventures

Home page internal links need to point to the correct locations
	- Geneaology and Personal can be relative links
	- Professional has to be an absolute link to closetothemachine
	
√ Every page needs a <br/> between title and first line of text.

Photographs pages
- √ Clicking on Photographs in top bar doesn't bring you to Photographs home.
- √ Make sidebars for all these pages consistent

√ Give Photographs and Treasure Trove the same sidebar as A La Page

√ Genealogy
- Fix headers--they should all look like the Families, or Home page


√ Put reference to, or quote from, Billionaires book review in A la Page.


√ Replace "--" with &mdash;
- In photographs

√ Elimintate all warnings

√ Change copyright on all pages.
- Use copyright symbol, &copy;
- Search and replace
&copy; 2013-2015 Jerry Kurlandski
&copy; 2013-2015 Jerry Kurlandski

√ Search for JERRY comments.

√ Standardize the "Jerry Kurlandski" on each web page.

√ Hello World is bad title for main page.

√ Banners need to be the same for all pages.

New page of my reading.
I'm tempted to say that I am what I've read, but I know that's an exageration. It just seems as though I am what I've read. Perhaps it's more accurate to say that reading has been the most interesting parts of my life; and that, perhaps, the most interesting thing about me is what I have read.

Check quotations.
- √ Should the Tom Sawyer quote have pampered instead of hampered?
- √ unpredententedly in Amis? Unprecedented?
- The Amis quotes should be fact-checked.

Quotes and a la Page sidebars should be quick-links to contents.
- Photographs could as well. But eventually it will be broken up into multiple pages--People, Places, etc.

√ Move the quotes which aren't permanently etched in me to A la Page

? Remove link to dying at 75 page

? Move photographs jpg's to separate image directory
