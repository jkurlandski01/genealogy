				<h3>Technical Details</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>Like the contents, the design of this website is an ongoing process which, hopefully, will give me a chance to learn a little more about web development. Details below.</p>

				<h2>Formatting</h2>
			</div>
			<p>The formatting of this page--indeed, this website--depends on a cascading style sheet (a .css file) which I obtained from FreeCssTemplates.org.</p>
			<p>As per their Creative Commons License, you'll find a link to their wonderful tools below.</p>
			<p>I'm too proud not to point out, however, that the changes I have made to the FreeCss template I borrowed have been so extensive that you may be hard put to identify it as you peruse their site.</p>

				<h2>Hosting</h2>
			</div>
			<p>My hosting site--the place where my website actually exists--is DreamHost.</p>
			<p>For a very reasonable rate, they let me put an unlimited amount of data on their servers. They offer a lot of technology as well as extensive documentation. And more than once I've had to contact their help desk, where the service is prompt, knowledgeable, and free. </p>
