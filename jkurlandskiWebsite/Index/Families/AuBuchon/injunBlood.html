				<h2>Are We Part-Injun, or What?</h2>
				<h3>The AuBuchon American Indian Ancestry</h3>
			</div>
		  <p>There's a certain cachet in being part-Native American. It's easy to find online sources which intend to expose famous people for making false claims about their Native American ancestry. What's not so easy to find is a credible explanation for why it seems so cool to have Indian roots. Nevertheless, it <em>is</em> cool.</p>
			<p>Into the many families that claim at least one Indian ancestor fall the AuBuchons. For many years now I've heard family rumors that we were part Native American. And, considering that our French ancestors landed here in the 1600's, the possibility seems not only plausible but, indeed, inevitable: how could those French trappers have <b>avoided</b> intimate contact with the indigenous people?</p>
			<p>Still, saying's one thing, proving's another. On this page I hope to document what evidence we have for this claim. Hopefully the page will also give a sense of the process of doing genealogical research, how it is endlessly frustrating, yet rewarding when, after much effort&mdash;and after following many leads into a dead-end&mdash;something that is probably close to the truth emerges.</p>

			<h4>Our Indian Roots, Version One</h4>
			<p>The first account of our Indian ancestry that I remember ever hearing goes something like this. My grandmother, Catherine AuBuchon, n&eacute;e Knoppe, once told the story of having a conversation with her husband's paternal grandmother. In this conversation, the elderly woman remembered aloud her youth spent on and Indian reservation in Oklahoma.</p>
            <p>Here's a snippet of the family tree showing the major players in this story, with my own mother, Corinne AuBuchon Kurlandski, as a point of reference.</p>
            <img id="fileIMG" src="./images/Hourglass Chart Corinne AUBUCHON.png">
            <p>As you can see, the woman my grandmother spoke to was Pelagie Mary David. The family tree has her birthplace as St. Genevieve, Missouri. If her birthplace is correct, then the story is probably mistaken in some way. Ascertaining her birthplace and childhood would be the direction to go if we were to folllow this lead.</p>

            <h4>Version Two, Having Much More Detail</h4>
            <p>The second account of our Indian ancestry comes from a recent email (dated January 2015) from my Aunt Virginia, my mom's sister.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">Our Indian ancestor was right here in Missouri. When Fran&ccedil;ois Vall&eacute; was Govenor of the Louisiana Territory, living in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, he fathered a daughter by an Indian woman and raised the girl, Marguerite, as a daughter of the family. She was given dowry, and when she was a young teenager he gave her a very large parcel of land, being afraid that when he died, her half siblings would not honor his wishes of what he wanted her to inherit. He chose a husband for her&mdash;Louis Caron, who was part French, part Spanish and maybe part Indian. They had a daughter, Pelagie, who married Louis Aubuchon. Louis and Pelagie had a son, Antoine, who I believe carried on the name until a couple of more generations when a George Aubuchon married a Bertha Franke, who were my grandparents and grandparents of your mom, Corinne.</p>

            <p>At the end of the email, Aunt Ginny makes it clear she's remembering all this off the top of her head. She promises to write again with more information. This probably explains why the names and relations she gives don't exactly match what is in the family tree. My copy of the tree, a large, rolled-up piece of paper whose connecting lines have not entirely withstood the test of time, has&mdash;if I am reading it right&mdash;the following for the connection from my mother going back to Marguerite Vall&eacute; and her father.</p>
            <img id="fileIMG" src="./images/TreeChartFrancoisVALLE.png">

            <p>So, if we were to follow the scent of this lead, the focus of our investigation should be Fran&ccedil;ois Vall&eacute; and his daughter, Marguerite. A quick internet search has produced the following items of interest.</p>
            <p><a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mikebartelt/valle-francois-1715.htm">Mike Barteit on Fran&ccedil;ois Vall&eacute;</a></p>
            <p><a href="http://www.geni.com/people/Marguerite-Valle/6000000000321646053">Marguerite Vall&eacute; on Geni</a></p>
            <p><a href="http://www.dnr.mo.gov/shpo/nps-nr/66000892.pdf">A record of historical St. Genevieve houses that mentions a "Louis Caron, son of Claude Caron and Charlotte La Chense. He married Marguerite Vall&eacute;, daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois Vall&eacute; Sr., in 1778."</a></p>
            <p><a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/c/a/Michael-E-Scaglione/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0789.html">Descendents of Marguerite Vall&eacute;</a></p>
            <p><a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/b/a/r/Michael-W-Bartelt/BOOK-0001/0002-0020.html">Webpage identifying Marguerite as half-Indian and illegitimate</a></p>

            <p>And, finally, here's a source that cites another source. This is the best lead so far, and worth quoting. But note that Marguerite is mentioned simply as "illegitimate," not Indian.</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">VALLE, François, I, habitant, merchant, political leader in Upper Louisiana. Born, Beauport, Quebec, January 2, 1716; son of Charles La Vallée and Geneviève Marcou. Removed to Illinois country. Married, Kaskaskia, January 7, 1748, Marianne Billeron, daughter of Léonard Billeron, royal notary, and Maire-Claire Catoise. Children: Marie-Louise (b. ca. 1750), Charles (b. ca. 1752), Joseph (b. ca. 1756), François II (q.v.), Jean-Baptiste (q.v.), Marguerite (illegitimate). Removed to Ste. Geneviève, ca. 1754; captain of the militia and civil judge at Ste. Geneviève, ca. 1759-1783; one of wealthiest and most powerful men in Upper Louisiana. Died, September 29, 1783; interred Ste. Geneviève. C.J.E. Sources: Mary L. Dalton, "Notes on the Geneology of the Vallé Family," Missouri Historical Society Collections, II (1906); Carl J. Ekberg, Colonial Ste. Geneviève (1957). </p>
            <p class="indentedQuote"><a href="http://www.lahistory.org/site39.php"><em>Dictionary of Louisiana Biography</em></a></p>
            <p>The next step would be to get our hands on one or both of the books cited above, and see if either contains any additional information on Marguerite.</p>

			<h4>Some Corroborating Evidence</h4>
			<p>My Aunt Virginia also forwarded me an email from her grandson, Dan&mdash;my second cousin, I suppose. In that email, Dan says:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">So we received grandma's full ancestry report today and it confirms she is 0.4% Native American.  That is precisely how much we would expect based on the number of generations ago the genealogy says.  They don't have any additional info on what tribe at this time, but they might add that ability in the future.</p>

            <p class="indentedQuote">About 99% of grandma's DNA is Northern European.  Mainly French and German but also Scandinavian and British Isles.  Not really any Eastern European, but the big surprise to me was the 0.5% Sardinian.  This would mean there is a relative from roughly 6 generations prior was 100% Sardinian.  I don't see anything in the genealogy with this so we have a bit of a mystery to investigate!</p>

            <p>(I assume that the "grandma" mentioned above is my Aunt Ginny.) I don't know much at all about DNA, and apart from the contents of the email quoted above I know nothing about how Ginny's ancestry was tested. But I'm pretty sure that the process is a little iffy, and the results not entirely reliable. To quote an article in Slate:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">But it’s impossible to come up with a meaningful rate of Native American heritage using DNA tests, at least for the moment. Using genetic material from the mitochondria (which is passed from mother to child) and from the Y-chromosome (passed from father to son), it's possible to trace ancestral origins along the male and female lines that run down each side of a person's family tree—his mother's mother's mother, his father's father's father, and so on. But progenitors anywhere in the middle, which constitute the overwhelming majority of a person's ancestry, are harder to trace, especially as the tree broadens. Geneticists are constantly improving their odds by identifying more telltale sequences that might survive the reshuffling across multiple generations, but the science is still young. (<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/05/elizabeth_warren_says_she_s_1_32nd_native_american_how_many_people_have_that_heritage_.html">Link to article by Brian Palmer.</a>)</p>

            <p>If I read this right, the DNA test Aunt Ginny had falls into the "harder to trace" category, because the line going back to Marguerite Vall&eacute;'s American Indian mother follows neither an all-male nor an all-female route.</p>
            <p>Also, if I count the generations right, the percentage of Native American DNA in Ginny (as well as my own mom), would be about 0.75%, which is pretty close to 0.4%. (Follow the tree above to check my math, which goes: Marguerite was 50% American Indian; her daughter, Carolyn, 25%; her daughter, Melanie, 12.5%; her son, Theodore, 6.25%; his son, George, 3.1 %; my grandfather, Frank, 1.5%; and his daughters, Virginia and Corinne, 0.75%.</p>
            <p>As I said above, though, I am familiar with little about all this, and maybe my calculations have nothing to do with the number 0.4% which Dan reports.</p>

            <h4>A New Lead</h4>
            <p>In March, 2016, I received an email from, as he put it, "a very distant cousin" named Dan Heise. He writes:</p>
            <p class="indentedQuote">I too am from the same line of Louis Caron and Marguerite Vall&eacute;. [...] The "Caron" (it changed to Carrow at some point or another) stuck around for a while, and it was only after my grandmother (maiden name Carrow) married my grandfather (last name Heise, like you see in my email/signature) that it kind of stopped in my line.</p>
			<p>He expressed some frustration with the dearth of information from those days in that part of the world, a frustration that I share. It stands to reason, though: remember that we're talking about a time not only before Missouri became a state, and not only before that side of the Mississippi was a part of the United States, but a time before there <em>was</em> a United States&mdash;and that a thousand miles to the east.</p>
			<p>Dan's email prompted me to do a little more digging.</p>
			<p>I started with Carolyn Caron on the family tree and tried to find Caron, Carron, or Carrow in the same <em>Dictionary of Louisiana Biography</em> quoted above. Nothing.</p>
			<p>So I googled (or actually yahood) "melanie celeste pepin". This led me to her page in the Geni website (www.geni.com); precisely two clicks later I was on <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Marguerite-Valle/6000000000321646053">Marguerite Vall&eacute;'s page</a>.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Birthdate: March 6, 1760</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Birthplace: Ste. Genevieve, Missouri</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Death: Died 1804</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Place of Burial: Ste. Genevieve, MO, USA</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">Immediate Family: Daughter of Fran&ccedil;ois Charles Vall&eacute;, Sr. and NN Amerindienne. Wife of Louis Carron. Mother of Joseph Carron, Julie Caron and Caroline Pepin. Half sister of Marie Louise Vall&eacute;, Charles Vall&eacute;, Joseph Vall&eacute;, Fran&ccedil;ois Charles Vall&eacute;, Jr. and Jean-Baptise Vall&eacute;.</p>
			<p>Eureka! ... Well, maybe not. A careful reader will have noticed that I had already been to this web page months before. I actually have a link to it above. But that's the way genealogy works. At least for me. In fits and starts. Panning for gold in a stream I've already panned and missed the nuggets that were there.</p>
			<p>The skeptic in me would like to see some documentation of the source(s) of this information. If it comes from the same source as the <em>Dictionary</em> quoted above, it's not corroborating evidence. However, if Geni's source was different, well, that could be very interesting. Against my skeptical nature, I do have to admit that all the additional information (Marguerite's birthplace, birth date and so on) strongly suggest that we have found a separate piece of evidence which lends credence to the proposition that we are part Injun after all. That would make four pieces of evidence, by my count: family lore (if you care to trust that), the <em>Dictionary of Louisiana Biography</em>, Aunt Ginny's DNA, and the Geni website.</p>
		<p>But, giving voice to the other side of my brain, we have to admit that the "NN Amerindienne" claim above could be nothing more than another piece of family lore&mdash;maybe some user who joined Geni just typed that in without any good, objective justification. In which case there are only three pieces of evidence.</p>
		<p>Maybe so, says the other half, but isn't it interesting the way they spelled "Indian"? Odd, you must admit. It's French, and it's so very French that the person who entered the word even used the feminine form of the noun. Which is very different from the all-English family lore I've heard over the years, and very different from the all-English <em>Dictionary</em> quoted above. Ergo, maybe we do have a fourth piece of evidence after all.</p>
		<p>I've come tantalizingly close to getting details on the Geni page for Marguerite. I joined Geni as a "basic" member and contacted the managers of the web page for her, practically begging for more information. One of the managers, a certain M. Anderson, has yet to provide details on the source of her information, but she did tell me that the "NN" is short for the latin <em>Nomen Nescio</em>, used by genealogists to signify and unknown or partially unknown name.</p>

            <h4>Fran&ccedil;ois Vall&eacute;</h4>
            <p>Somewhere in my research I learned of the existence of a biography of Marguerite's father&mdash;<em>Fran&ccedil;ois Vall&eacute; and His World: Upper Louisiana Before Lewis and Clark</em> by Carl J. Ekberg.</p>
            <p>If you only like military history, this is not the book for you. But if you like the kind of history that gives you a sense of life in the distant past, I think you'll enjoy it. It is extremely thorough and carefully documented, and the life of this illiterate pioneer who moved from a small town in Quebec to become one of the richest men of Upper Louisiana makes for a very interesting read.</p>
            <p>I hope to add to this page what information Ekberg offers about Marguerite. Unfortunately, at the time he wrote the book (circa 2002), nothing was known about the girl's mother. We can only speculate that the woman was probably an African or Native American slave.</p>
			<p>I have written to Professor Ekberg asking if any more information on Marguerite has come to light since he published this book. A long shot, I know. But I thought I'd give it a try.</p>

            <h4>My To-Do List</h4>
            <p>Here are some links and notes that I hope to explore in the (apparently) never-ending quest to answer the question, "Are we part-Injun, or what?" Some of these also appear as links in the narrative above.</p>
            <p><a href="http://shsmo.org/historicmissourians/name/v/valle/">Historic Missourians page on Fran&ccedil;ois Vall&eacute;.</a> This is the first stop if you'd like to learn more about Vall&eacute;. It has a passing reference to Marguerite: "Together the couple had six children: four boys and two girls. Vallé had another daughter, Marguerite, from an extramarital relationship. No details are known about her birth mother, but Marguerite was raised in the Vallé household along with the rest of the Vallé children."; book cited: Crist, Helen Vall&eacute;. <em>They Was Frenchmans: The Vall&eacute; Family Legacy</em>. Brea, CA: Creative Continuum, 2003. [REF F508.2 V242cr]. But this book is probably not useful since the article says ""little is known," and it was published only a year after Ekberg's biography.</p>
