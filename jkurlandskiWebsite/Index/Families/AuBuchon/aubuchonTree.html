				<h2>AuBuchon Family Tree</h2>
			</div>
			<p>For about fifty years now, my mother has had a copy of her family tree. It was done by hand, in pencil, and by now the pencil lines connecting individuals to each other and their offspring are often completely faded. I don't know where the tree originally came from, but hope to eventually find out. This is an electronic copy of that paper copy.</p>
			<p>Apart from my mother at the very end of the lineage, I have not added anything to the tree, even though while working on it I have uncovered some additional information. I've done this so that a cousin, for example, with another copy of the tree can easily check the version below to see if I made any errors in transferring the contents to this electronic copy. (I'd be very grateful if anyone out there alerted me to any mistakes I might have made.)</p>
			<p>The only changes I have made to the contents of the paper family tree are to correct obvious spelling errors, including these:</p>
			<ul class="style3">
			<li>The paper copy has the father of John Baptiste Thaumur and the son of Dominique Thaumur as "Dominique Thamur." (Note, however, that I have remained true to the paper copy for the last name spelling of his granddaughter, Marie Louise Thumure, since, after all, the spelling of surnames can change over time.)</li>
			<li>When trying to make out some of the French place names, I ended up having to google them. If this led me to discovering a misspelling, I inserted the correct version into the electronic copy of the family tree.</li>
			<li>A distant ancestor, Louis Sédilot, had a wife whose name is a little difficult to make out in my paper copy--it looks like Marie Gaimoult. I discovered a Wikipedia entry for Louis, which has his wife's maiden name as "Grimoult." I followed the Wikipedia entry.</li>
			<li>Finally, for the French-speaking ancestors, I used the special French characters 'é', 'è', 'ç' and so on when I noticed their absence.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can see two sets of starred entries in the tree below, one set in blue and one set in purple. These indicate individuals who appear in the tree more than once. For example, the purple-starred François and Louise Lalumondière had two daughters, Thérèse and Catherine. Five generations later, the descendants of these two women had a family reunion, perhaps unwittingly, when my great-grandparents Bertha Louise Frank and George Francis AuBuchon married.</p>
			<p>One last point. To guarantee its legibility, I am using a very large image for the family tree below. This may cause delays in opening the page. Please be patient.</p>
