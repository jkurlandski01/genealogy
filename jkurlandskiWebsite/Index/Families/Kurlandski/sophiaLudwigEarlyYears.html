				<h2>Sophia &amp; Ludwig,</h2>
				<h2>the Early Years</h2>
			</div>
			<p>On this page we explore the early years of the marriage of Sophia and Ludwig Kurlandski, my great-grandparents on my father's father's side.</p>
			<h3><a id="Before1910">Before 1910</a></h3>
			<p>In 1901, Ludwig Kurlandsky left Poland via Antwerp and joined his brother in St. Louis. What happened next is, at this point, largely speculation. Probably he became part of the Polish immigrant community on the North Side. If he was like most Polish Catholic immigrants of the time, much of his social life would have centered around St. Stanislaus Church there. </p>

			<br />
			<p>We don't know when Ludwig met Sophia Wroblewski, but thanks to the 1910 census we can speculate that they married between 1903 (the year her last child from John Wroblewski was born) and 1907 (the year her first child with Ludwig was born). See the summary of the census below.</p>
			<h3><a id="1910">1910</a></h3>
			<p>The 1910 Census has the family living in St. Louis's Fourth Ward. It appears that by this time my great-grandfather had changed the spelling of both his first and his last name: Ludwig Kurlandsky, immigrant, had become Ludwik Kurlanski, head of househould. We will probably  never know how this happened, whether he really did change these spellings, or if the changes were the result of census-taking error.</p>
			<p>At this time he was living with two children of his own, and with two children by Sophia's first marriage. The couple's eldest child is listed as Katie. Until recently in my genealogical quest, I had heard no mention of her in our family's oral history. She would be listed as Catherine in the 1920 Census, and at that point she disappears. But now I have heard a tidbit of information that is so enticing that, with optimistic abandon, I have decided to dedicate a separate page to her alone. See the "Katie Kurlanski" link at right.</p>

			<br />
			<p>As you can see from the link above, the information on the Family Search website is a bit scanty. It does not even include their address, but gives their home only as in the Fourth Ward. Yet good fortune has made it easy for me to gain access to the actual census record for Ludwig and Sophia's household. My new job is in downtown Manhattan, and as I look out of the software developers' window on the eleventh floor of our building, I can see the Statue of Liberty and, on its right, Ellis Island, where Ludwig arrived over a century ago. And when I step outside, I am but two blocks away from a National Archives office.</p>
			<p>The office is in a beautiful building which now houses the National Museum of the American Indian. Originally the edifice was built for the U.S. Custom offices in New York City. Construction began in 1900 and finished in 1907--though the cornerstone I pass nearly every day reads 1902. It is likely that Ludwig, if had paid a visit to New York City before boarding the train that took him to St. Louis in 1901, would have passed by the location, and seen only a large pit and just the beginnings of the exterior walls.</p>
			<p><a href="http://nmai.si.edu/visit/newyork/architecture-history/">Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House</a></p>
			<p>A few weeks ago I paid the National Archives office there a visit, and within 45 minutes I left with a photocopy of Sophia and Ludwig's page in the 1910 U.S. Census.</p>

			<p>1: "Number of Years of Present (?) Marriage""</p>
			<p>This information is valuable, but it forces us to ask a couple of questions. First, assuming that "M 2" means that the person is in his or her second marriage, then we have to wonder whether the "M 2" on Ludwig's line is an accident. We know this was Sophia's second marriage, but it's probably wise to be skeptical that this was also Ludwig's.</p>
			<p>The second set of doubts relates to the information given in the next column to the right. First of all, on the form the top of the column is a little hard to read, so I can't be absolutely sure that the question concerns the number of years of the person's present marriage. But if that is indeed the question, I also have to wonder about the answers given: if Sophia and Ludwig had been married only two years by 1910, that would mean that three-year-old Katie had been born out of wedlock. Probably the only way we'll know for sure is if, somehow, we obtain both Katie's birth certificate and her parents' marriage certificate.</p>
			<p>The next set of information pertains to our relatives' enthnicity and origin.</p>

			<p>1: "Place of birth of each person, and parents of each person (illegible). If born in the United States, give the state or territory. If of foreign birth, give the country.""</p>
			<p>2: "Whether able to speak English; or, if not, give language spoken.""</p>
			<p>Of course I have some questions about all this as well. I'm not sure what the "O" in "Ger-Polish O" means. An internet search has revealed only the fact that other researchers have been equally mystified. The same internet search produced the following instructions for the census takers of the 1904 State of Michigan Census:</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">In case a person speaks Polish, as Poland is not now a country, inquire whether the birth place was what is now known as German Poland, Austrian Poland or Russian Poland, and enter the answer accordingly as Polish (Ger.), Polish (Aust.), Polish (Rus.).</p>	
			<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6k0aAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR50&lpg=PR50&dq=census+ger-polish+o&source=bl&ots=p9dtP3WT2u&sig=Zj0nF-9qSCgIlU-pC-9NynUt5vw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JT68UtKxJoOSyAH1uYD4AQ&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=census%20ger-polish%20o&f=false">1904 State of Michigan Census instructions</a></p>
			<p>Perhaps the entry in the census means something like, "Born in Germany, of Polish origin."</p>
			<p>We note the error in the next column, regarding Ludwig's year of immigration, and move on to the column after. Here the question concerns whether the person is naturalized (i.e., has become a citizen) or alien. All the other answers on this page are either "Na" or "Al". Yet the answer in Ludwig's row is unmistakably "Pa." I'm not sure what to make of this.</p>
			<p>Another obvious question concerns why there is no entry for Sophia's citizenship. Notice that, on the entire page, this entry applies only to the heads of household. This may be related to a fact that W. Daniel Quillen points out, in his book <em>Mastering Online Geneology</em>: before 1922, women and minors could become citizens when their husbands and fathers did (p. 122).</p> 
			<p>As a final point, it's worth noting that the census also tells us that Ludwig's English must have been minimal; at the very least we can say that Sophia's was probably better.</p>
			<p>Apart from whether the individual can read and write--Ludwig and Sophia both answered Yes--the remaining questions of interest ask about financial concerns, and were answered only for Ludwig. We'll deal with that in a separate section below. But right now we're going to discuss what the census reveals about their home and neighborhood.</p>
			<br />
			<h3><a id="The Neighborhood">The Neighborhood</a></h3>
			<p>The left-hand side of the census page shows that the family was living at 1920-A Carr Street. If I read the numbers right, my guess is that they lived in a six-flat building with the following addresses: 1920 A (the Kurlanski/Wroblewski household, consisting of six people), 1920 (housing five people, the Wehmyers and the Christians), 1920-1/2 A (containing six Dawidowskis), 1920-1/2 (consisting of a family of three named Erikson), another 1920-1/2 A (represented by a couple named Lowe), and, finally, one more 1920 (the four-member Preuss family). The neighbors in this and nearby buildings included American-born citizens as well as immigrants hailing from Ireland, Germany, Sweden and Poland. Unless Ludwig was completely anti-social, we can presume his English was good enough to say hello. In short, he did not live in an all-Polish ghetto.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, I was able to find a very old photograph taken of a shaving parlor just nine blocks away from their home. It gives us a good sense of what the neighborhood looked like. To me, the two- and three-story brick structures are very reminiscent of South St. Louis, where the family would move a few decades later.</p>

			<p>The map below, from the modern-day perspective of Google maps, depicts their neighborhood, and shows how their move sometime between 1910 and 1918 did not take them far away from their local friends and family. Notice St. Stanislaus Church, slightly to the west but equidistant from the two homes.</p>

			<p>The next photo was taken at Olive and Seventh. Being a 25-minute walk away, it does not at all reflect the look of their neighborhood, but it does give you a taste of the times--or, at least, of the times as they had been ten years before, at the turn of the century.</p>

			</div>
			<p>Of course, their neighborhood looked nothing like this. For a hint of what has happened since those days, have a look at the following brief history of the neighborhood.</p>
			<p class="indentedQuote">The depression and World War II brought blacks into the area in large numbers. They moved into decrepit buildings. These were structures which were erected in the days before indoor plumbing and central heating and were "remodelled" by their landlords into even smaller crowded living units. Large portions of these slums were replaced by public housing projects, beginning with Carr Square Village in 1942. Some of these complexes acquired slum-like status by the mid 1960's, leading to the ultimate demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe Apartments. The eventual re-use of these sites is presently undetermined. Urban renewal in the DeSoto-Carr area and construction of the new Convention Center are expected to lead to a rejuvenation of the portion of the area south of Cass Avenue.</p>

			<br />
			<h3><a id="Ludwig's Profession">Ludwig's Professions</a></h3>
			<p>The 1910 Census has Ludwig employed as a blacksmith. I have enough information on this and his other occupatins to merit a separate page. Click on the link "Ludwig Kurlandsky Careers" link at right.</p>
			<h3><a id="1918">1918: Frank is Born</a></h3>
			<p>Sophia and Ludwig's sixth child together, Francis, was born in 1918. I knew him as Uncle Frank, though in fact he was my great-uncle. I think of Uncle Frank and Aunt Georgia as, first and foremost, poker players. I remember once they arrived at our house in St. Peters with a deck of cards--and left with most of the money on the table. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself here.</p>
			<p>Rene Kurlandski, Frank's daughter, has shared some interesting information from her father's birth certificate. It shows they lived at 1613 Helen Street when Frank was born, and that at the time "Louis" was 41 years old and Sophia was 43. Rene reports that the certificate has both of them being born in Germany, which agrees with the 1910 census, but contradicts what was reported in the census of 1920 and all those after. (See ""On the Trail of Sophia and Louis.")</p>
			<p>Rene also has her father's birth certificate, showing that he was bapitized at St. Stanislaus Church on October 28, 1918, just three days after he was born. His sponsors were John Soldynski and Monika Wroblewski.</p>
			<p>Some interesting points about this information include:</p>
			<ul class="style3">
			<li>By 1918 Ludwig had begun calling himself "Louis."</li>
			<li>Most records have Ludwig as being one to two years older than Sophia, not the other way around.</li>
			<li>Finally, Monica Wroblewski must have been from the family of Sophia's first husband. I have no record of her.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>According to Google Maps, the new place on Helen Street would have been about a half mile's walking distance away from the old flat. See the map above.</p>
