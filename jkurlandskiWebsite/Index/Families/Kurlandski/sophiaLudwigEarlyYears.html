<!-- jerry			<span class="image image-full"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
				<p>On this page we explore the early years of the marriage of Sophia and Ludwig Kurlandski, my great-grandparents on my father's father's side.</p>
<!-- 				<h3>Before 1910</h3> -->
				<h3><a id="Before1910">Before 1910</a></h3>
				<p>In 1901, Ludwig Kurlandsky left Poland via Antwerp and joined his brother in St. Louis. What happened next is, at this point, largely speculation. Probably he became part of the Polish immigrant community on the North Side. If he was like most Polish Catholic immigrants of the time, much of his social life would have centered around St. Stanislaus Church there. </p>

				<p></p>
				<p>We don't know when Ludwig met Sophia Wroblewski, but thanks to the 1910 census we can speculate that they married between 1903 (the year her last child from John Wroblewski was born) and 1907 (the year her first child with Ludwig was born). See the summary of the census below.</p>
				<h3><a id="1910">1910</a></h3>
				<p>The 1910 Census has the family living at 1920 Carr Street in St. Louis's Fourth Ward. By this time my great-grandfather had changed the spelling of both his first and his last name: Ludwig Kurlandsky, immigrant, had become Ludwik Kurlanski, head of househould. We probably will never know how this happened, whether by accident or intention.</p>
				<p>At this time he was living with two children of his own, and with two children by Sophia's first marriage. The couple's eldest child is listed as Katie. Until recently in my genealogical quest, I had heard no mention of her in our family's oral history. She would be listed as Catherine in the 1920 Census, and at that point she disappears. But now I have heard a tidbit of information that is so enticing that, with optimistic abandon, I have decided to dedicate a separate page to her alone. See the "Katie Kurlanski" link at right.</p>

				<p></p>
				<p>As you can see from the link above, the information on the Family Search website is a bit scanty. It does not even include their address, but gives their home only as in the Fourth Ward. Yet good fortune has made it easy for me to gain access to the actual census record for Ludwig and Sophia's household. My new job is in downtown Manhattan, and as I look out of the software developers' window on the eleventh floor of our building, I can see the Statue of Liberty and, on its right, Ellis Island, where Ludwig arrived over a century ago. And when I step outside, I am but two blocks away from a National Archives office.</p>
				<p>The office is in a beautiful building which now houses the National Museum of the American Indian. Originally the edifice was built for the U.S. Custom offices in New York City. Construction began in 1900 and finished in 1907--though I'm pretty sure the cornerstone I pass nearly every day reads 1902. It is most likely that Ludwig, if had paid a visit to New York City before boarding the train that took him to St. Louis in 1901, would have passed by the location, and seen only a large pit and just the beginnings of the exterior walls.</p>

				<p>A few weeks ago I paid the National Archives office there a visit, and within 45 minutes I left with a photocopy of Sophia and Ludwig's page in the 1910 U.S. Census.</p>

				<p></p>
				<p>I will soon have more on what I have learned from this census, but here's a quick summary:</p>
				<ul class="style3">
				<li>Ludwig was a blacksmith, working at a wagon factory.</li>
				<li>Their building had four flats in it, two in the front and two in the rear.</li>
				<li>The couple was not living in an all-Polish ghetto. They had German and Irish neighbors.</li>
				<li>The census-taker had trouble distinguishing between the language of Switzerland and the language of Sweden.</li>
				</ul>
				<p></p>
				<h3><a id="1918">1918: Frank is Born</a></h3>
				<p>Sophia and Ludwig's sixth child together, Francis, was born in 1918. I knew him as Uncle Frank, though in fact he was my great-uncle. I think of Uncle Frank and Aunt Georgia as, first and foremost, poker players. I remember once they arrived at our house in St. Peters with a deck of cards--and left with most of the money on the table. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself here.</p>
				<p>Rene Kurlandski, Frank's daughter, has shared some interesting information from her father's birth certificate. It shows they lived at 1613 Helen Street when Frank was born, and that at the time "Louis" was 41 years old and Sophia was 43. Rene reports that the certificate has both of them being born in Germany, which agrees with the 1910 census, but contradicts what was reported in the census of 1920 and all those after. (See ""On the Trail of Sophia and Louis.")</p>
				<p>Rene also has her father's birth certificate, showing that he was bapitized at St. Stanislaus Church on October 28, 1918, just three days after he was born. His sponsors were John Soldynski and Monika Wroblewski.</p>
				<p>Some interesting points about this information include:</p>
				<ul class="style3">
				<li>By 1918 Ludwig had begun calling himself "Louis."</li>
				<li>Most records have Ludwig as being one to two years older than Sophia, not the other way around.</li>
				<li>Finally, Monica Wroblewski must have been from the family of Sophia's first husband. I have no record of her.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>According to Google Maps, the new place on Helen Street would have been about a half mile's walking distance away from the old flat.</p>
