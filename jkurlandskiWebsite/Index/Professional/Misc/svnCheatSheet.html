            <p>JERRY: Red bar at top needs to point to this page's subtopic </p>

            <p>JERRY: add/delete items to sidebar</p>
            
            <p>JERRY: conduct a move test; I think it must be followed by add/delete of what you've moved</p>
            
            <p>Here's a quick guide--for my own use as much as anyone else's--to the SVN commands I most often use.</p>
            <p>A similar resource is the very useful "SVN Cheat Sheet" written up by AddedBytes.com. I've taken the liberty of adding their pdf to the internal links at right, rather than to the external links, because lately the document seems to have disappeared from the Internet.</p>
            <p>Note: in the explanations below, the term "item" refers to both files and directories.</p>
            
            <h3>SVN Status</h3>
            <p>This set of commands compares your changes to other versions of the code base.</p>

                    </div>
                <li>$ svn status -u</li>
                <p>Compare local version to the repository itself. Tells you what updates to the repository are not in the local version. In addition to the status of local changes given in the left-most column of the output, this command returns the repository status of items in the middle and right columns--see the table at right for these symbols. The command ends by displaying "Status against revision:" plus a revision number; this is the latest revision in the repository.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn status --no-ignore</li>
                <p>Run the "svn status" command, but include in the output the status of ignored items.</p>
            </div>
            

            <h3>SVN Update</h3>
            <p>Moves recent changes from the repository to your local working copy.</p>
            
            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn update</li>
                <p>Updates your local working copy with the latest from the repository.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>SVN Commit</h3>
            <p>Commits not only commit your modifications to the repository, but also commit the addition or removal of files to the repository; in other words, an "svn add" and "svn remove" must be followed by a commit.</p>
            
            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn commit -m "your message" &lt;item&gt;</li>
                <p>Commit a single item, with a message that will go into the file's history.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn commit -m "your message"</li>
                <p>Recursively commit your local changes to the repository. The message becomes part of the change history.</p>
            </div>
            
            
            <h3>SVN Add</h3>
            <p>This set of commands adds files and directories to the repository. They deal only with items whose status is marked by a question mark ("?"). Note that <code>svn add </code> must all be followed by a commit.</p>
            
            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn add &lt;item&gt;</li>
                <p>Add the file to the repository. If &lt;filename&gt; is a directory, all unversioned subfolders and files will also be added.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ for i in  $(svn status | grep \? | awk '{print $2}'); do svn add $i; done</li>
                <p>Probably your best bet for a recursive add. This Unix command recursively adds all new files to the repository, whether their directories are versioned or unversioned. The command works by adding all files whose status is "?", so it does not operate on your ignored files, as these do not appear in the status command.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn add *</li>
                <p>Recursively add all new items to the repository. This command skips over versioned directories, i.e. it will not add unversioned files in a versioned directory (or even a non-versioned directory in a versioned directory). Note that this command will also add files/folders in the current directory which are in your ignore list!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn add * --force</li>
                <p>Recursively add all new items to the repository, whether their directories are versioned or unversioned. Note that this command will also add files/folders in the current directory which are in your ignore list! (See the Unix command below if this is a problem.)</p>
            </div>


            <h3>SVN Move</h3>
            <p>This set of commands moves or renames a file or directory. Moving or renaming a file through SVN is better than simply doing it through your operating system, because the file's change history will be maintained. (That is, SVN will copy the history of the old file to the new file's history.)</p>
            <p>Note that these changes must all be followed by a commit.</p>
            <p>Also note that SVN may not at first let you do this commit. If you get the message "Item ... is out of date," don't panic. Do an svn update (see above), which will seemingly do nothing, but which in fact will let you perform the commit.</p>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn move &lt;oldItemName&gt; &lt;newItemName&gt;</li>
                <p>Rename a file/directory.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn move &lt;oldPath/item&gt; &lt;newPath/item&gt;</li>
                <p>Move a file/directory.</p>
            </div>


            <h3>SVN Remove/Delete</h3>
            <p>This set of commands removes a specific file or directory from the repository. The following svn commands behave identically: <code>remove, delete, rm, del</code>. Note that these changes must all be followed by a commit.</p>
            
            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn rm &lt;item&gt;</li>
                <p>Remove the file/directory from both your filesystem and the repository.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn rm --keep-local &lt;item&gt;</li>
                <p>Remove the file/directory from the repository, but not locally. This will generally be an important file or directory, e.g. .classpath. Ordinarily you will also want to <code>ignore</code> this file as well--see below.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ for i in  $(svn status | grep \! | awk '{print $2}'); do svn delete $i; done</li>
                <p>Unix command to recursively delete all missing files from the repository, whether their directories are versioned or unversioned. The command works by deleting all files whose status is "!". Since, unlike <code>add</code>, there is no recursive version of <code>delete</code>, this command can sometimes be very useful--for example, if you've deleted many files in several directories via your operating system.</p>
            </div>


            <h3>SVN Ignore</h3>
            <p>Use svn's ignore property to avoid putting items into the repository. You do this, for example, with files that may differ from one machine to the next, as with .classpath settings--or with files which are produced in the compilation process, as with .class or .exe files and the directories which contain them.</p>
            
            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ export SVN_EDITOR=vim</li>
                <p>Sets your property editor to vim; useful if the command below fails because you have no property editor. Note that vi and vim are powerful but not user friendly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn propedit svn:ignore .</li>
                <p>This will bring up your text editor so you can enter a list of files or directories to ignore. Applicable only to those files and folders in the current directory.</p>
            </div>


            <h3>Less often used SVN commands</h3>
            <p>These commands are useful, but tend not to be used as often as the ones above.</p>
            
            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn list</li>
                <p>List the items in the current directory which exist in the repository.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn checkout &lt;URL&gt;</li>
                <p>Creates a local version of the repository, by linking the current directory to the repository and copying the files at the repository location to the current location in your file system. If a password is required you will be prompted with your computer user name as the default logon user name; if that is not correct, the password will fail and you'll be given a chance to input both the repository user name and the repository password.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="singleSpacedDescription">
                <li>$ svn diff &lt;item&gt;</li>
                <p>Does a Unix-style diff of the file and the base revision.</p>
            </div>
