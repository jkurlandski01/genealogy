				<h2>SVN Tasks</h2>
			</div>
            <p>This page shows you how to link individual SVN commands together in order to accomplish a particular <em>task</em>.</p>
            <p>The SVN command line can be a little intimidating at first, but it becomes less so when you think of the commands not in isolation but as part of a series of steps with a single aim in mind. If the individual commands are like words, then this page shows you how to string these words together to form a coherent sentence.</p>
            <p>This page will probably make sense even if you're not yet familiar with the SVN commands being used. In either case, for more information on each command you can refer to the internal link on SVN Commands in the sidebar.</p>
            
            <h3>Task</h3>
            <h4>&bull; Update your working directory so that it has the latest version in the repository, leaving local changes untouched.</h4>
            <h4>&bull; Then commit local changes to the repository.</h4>

            <br/>
            <p>First check the status to see if there are any conflicts. Conflicts are marked with a capital "C"&mdash;see below for an example.</p>
            
<pre class="preCode">
$ svn status
?       Misc/svnExamples.html
M       toDo.txt

$ svn status -u
        *       74   Misc/svnCheatSheet.html
?                    Misc/svnExamples.html
        *       74   Misc/svnNotes.txt
M                    toDo.txt
Status against revision:     77
</pre>

            <p>Locally, toDo.txt has been modified, and svnExamples.html is new to the file system but has not been added to the repository. On the repository side, the repository is at Revision 77, but it contains two files&mdash;svnCheatSheet.html and svnNotes.html&mdash;from Revision 74 that have not been copied locally.</p>
            
            <p>The status checks reveal no conflicts, meaning that you have not locally changed a file that has been changed and committed by someone else. How can you tell? The "svn status -u" uses the leftmost column to mark local changes, and the second column to mark remote changes. You see that none of the four files is marked in both columns. (See another task below for an example of exactly what a conflict looks like.)</p>
            <p>Since there are no conflicts, perform the update. Then check status again.</p>
            
<pre class="preCode">
$ svn update
Updating '.':
U    Misc/svnCheatSheet.html
U    Misc/svnNotes.txt

$ svn status -u
?                    Misc/svnExamples.html
M                    toDo.txt
Status against revision:     77

</pre>

            <p>Your working copy is now up-to-date with the repository. The local changes aren't ready to be committed because you haven't explicity stated you want the new file to be added to the repository. Do so now.</p>
            
<pre class="preCode">
$ svn add Misc/svnExamples.html
A                   Misc/svnExamples.html

$ svn status
A                    Misc/svnExamples.html
M                    toDo.txt
Status against revision:     77
</pre>

            <p>Finally you're ready to commit.</p>
            
<pre class="preCode">

            <br/>
            <p>First perform the move and the delete commands, checking status along the way. In this example, we're moving mySqlCheatSheet.html out of the Databases folder and into the Misc folder. Then we'll remove all the files which remain in the Databases folder.</p>

            <h4>&bull; Use "svn update" to reset status so that you can perform a commit</h4>
            <p>Sometimes SVN doesn't let you do a commit when it seems as though it should. I've noticed this can happen after I move or delete a file or a directory. What often fixes the problem is an SVN update that, apparently, does nothing.</p>

            <h3>Task</h3>
            <h4>&bull; Use propedit svn:ignore to ignore a .project file</h4>
            <p>Suppose you work in Eclipse or some other IDE that stores user-specific data in a .project file. Since the settings here are not applicable to those of other developers, you don't want this information stored in the repository.</p>
            <p>In the steps below we first try to edit the svn:ignore properties, but find that we need to tell SVN which editor we want to use. We choose vim. Then we try to open the editor again&mdash;successfully this time.</p>
<pre class="preCode">
$ svn propedit svn:ignore .
svn: E205007: None of the environment variables SVN_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR are set, and no 'editor-cmd' run-time configuration option was found

$ export SVN_EDITOR=vim

$ svn propedit svn:ignore .
</pre>

            <p>At this point vim will open the properties file. You want to insert the following line into the editor.</p>
<pre class="preCode">
.project
</pre>
            
            <p>In vim, you insert this line with the following key sequence:</p>
<pre class="preCode">
i
.project
&lt;esc-key&gt;
ZZ
</pre>
            <p>Here's a crash course in vim. "i" allows for inserting text. Then you can type the text you want to insert. You get out of insert mode with the Escape key. Then you save and exit with "ZZ".</p>

            <p>At this point you can verify that you've modified the ignore property by seeing that "." (meaning this directory) has been changed.</p>
            
<pre class="preCode">
$ svn status
 M      .
</pre>
            
            <br/>
            <h3>Task</h3>
            <h4>&bull; Use "svn update" to merge a file that has both been changed locally and been modified by another user.</h4>

            <br/>
            <p>(This task shows you how to let SVN merge files that have been changed both locally and by another user, though, in fact, I don't recommend doing so. To me, any chance that SVN won't do the merge correctly is not a risk worth taking. Read on to find out what I think is a better way.)</p>
            <p>Check the status of both your changes and recent changes to the repository.</p>
            
<pre class="preCode">
$ svn status -u
M              144   index.html
M       *      140   Java/unitTesting.html
        *            Java/enum.html
Status against revision:    144
</pre>
            <p>The status check returns information on three files. One file, index.html, has been changed locally&mdash;the "M" in the leftmost column tells you this. The second file, enum.html has been changed by someone else and this change has been committed to the repository&mdash;as indicated by the asterisk in the second column. And the third file, unitTesting.html has been changed locally, and had its repository version updated by some other user&mdash;the output of the status check indicates this by leaving items in both the first and the second columns.</p>
            <p>Let's update just unitTesting.html.</p>

<pre class="preCode">
$ svn update Java/unitTesting.html
Updating 'Java/unitTesting.html':
G    Java/unitTesting.html
Updated to revision 144.

$ svn status -u
M              144   Index/Personal/index.html
M              144   Java/unitTesting.html
        *            Index/Professional/Java/enum.html
</pre>

            <p>Now your local version of unitTesting.html has all the changes that the other user committed, plus your local changes: SVN was smart enough to see that the two sets of changes took place in different parts of the file. SVN indicates that the merge has taken place by putting a "G" in the leftmost column.</p>
            <p>Or at least that's how it works in theory. You might be wise to be untrustworthy of this, though. In my opinion, you really should carefully review the result of this automatic merge.</p>
            <p>Sometimes SVN realizes it can't do the merge automatically. The case, called a conflict, is described in the next task below.</p>
            <p>To sum up, then: anytime you do an "svn status -u," and the first and second columns tell you that both you and someone else have modified a file, I suggest you NOT do an update on that file. Instead, perform the merge manually yourself. How? There are ways to do this from the command line, but that's one task I have never done from the command line. Whenever I find myself in this situation, I always go to my IDE, whether it's Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. Because for the sometimes-confusing and always-risky task of merging, you can't beat the visual diff tools that an IDE can offer.</p>
            <p>In the scenario described at the start of this task, the next two steps are to do an "svn update" to pick up the changes to enum.html; then do a commit. Since you've already seen the examples of these above, we don't need to show you how to do them now.</p>

            <br/>
            <h3>Task</h3>
            <h4>&bull; Perform an update on a file that has been changed both locally and by someone else.</h4>
            <h4>&bull; See what happens when SVN marks the file as a conflict.</h4>
            <br/>
            
            <p>In this scenario, you first do an "svn status -u," and see that a file needs to be merged.</p>

<pre class="preCode">
$ svn status -u
M       *      155   utils/DialogUtility.java
</pre>

            <p>Then you perform an update, and see that&mdash;<em>zut alors!</em>&mdash;SVN can't do an automatic merge. Hit "p" to postpone the merge and deal with it later.</p>

<pre class="preCode">
$ svn update

Conflict discovered in 'utils/DialogUtility.java'.
Select: (p) postpone, (df) diff-full, (e) edit,
        (mc) mine-conflict, (tc) theirs-conflict,
        (s) show all options: p
C    utils/DialogUtility.java
Updated to revision 165.
Summary of conflicts:
Text conflicts: 1
</pre>

            <p>In this scenario's next step, you do an "svn status" to see what the situation is, and discover new files that you never created.</p>

<pre class="preCode">
$ svn status
C       utils/DialogUtility.java
?       utils/DialogUtility.java.mine
?       utils/DialogUtility.java.r155
?       utils/DialogUtility.java.r165
Summary of conflicts:
  Text conflicts: 1
</pre>

            <p>The final step of the scenaro has you wishing that you'd taken my advice (see above), and performed the merge manually.</p>

            <p>In the listing above, note the "C," which of course stands for "confilct." SVN has left you with three new files, and a new version of DialogUtility.java. DialogUtility.java.r155 is the version of the file that you last obtained from the repository; this is the version that you did your work in. DialogUtility.java.r165 is the latest version in the repository. DialogUtility.java.mine is not "mine"&mdash;it's yours. It's the version of the file you had before you did the ill-fated update.... So if DialogUtility.java.mine has all your recent modifications to the file, then what is in DialogUtility.java?</p>
            <p>The answer is, nothing pretty. And nothing that will compile. Here's the kind of thing you'll see there.</p>

<pre class="preCode">
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; .mine
=======
    public static List&lt;String&gt; COMMON_VERBS = ImmutableList.of(
    &quot;ask&quot;, &quot;be&quot;, &quot;call&quot;, &quot;come&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;find&quot;, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;give&quot;, &quot;go&quot;, &quot;have&quot;, &quot;know&quot;, &quot;let&quot;, &quot;look&quot;, &quot;make&quot;, &quot;mean&quot;, &quot;need&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;say&quot;, &quot;take&quot;, &quot;tell&quot;, &quot;think&quot;, &quot;want&quot;);
    
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; .r165
</pre>

            <p>What this is telling you is that your latest version of DialogUtilty.java doesn't have a static field called COMMON_VERBS, and that someone else changed this same field in some way, maybe by adding a new element to the list.</p>
            <p>You have a couple of options. You could decide which of the three new files you want to keep, and rename it to "DialogUtility.java." In this case you would delete the two remaining files. But probably what you want is to keep both your changes and the changes of the last person who committed the file to the repository. This means going through DialogUtility.java, searching for "=====", and for each diff figuring out which version you want. (Once finished, you'll need to use the "svn resolve" command.)</p>
            <p>Does this seem a pain? Well, you can't say I didn't tell you so. (See above.) Despite the fact that I'm repeating myself, the morale of this story is:</p>
            <p><strong>Anytime you do an "svn status -u," and the first and second columns tell you that both you and someone else have modified a file, I suggest you NOT do an update on that file. Instead, perform the merge manually yourself. How? That's up to you, but for myself, I always go to my IDE, because for the sometimes-confusing and always-risky task of merging, you can't beat the visual diff tools that an IDE can offer.</strong></p>
