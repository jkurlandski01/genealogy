SVN
Ã svn checkout <URL>
Ã svn status --show-updates; svn status -u
- What repository updates aren't local?

Ã $ svn rm --keep-local my_important_file
This removes the file from version control without removing it from your filesystem.
svn commit my_important_file -m "Removing .classpath from repository."

Ignoring more than one item in a directory.
export SVN_EDITOR=vim
svn propedit svn:ignore .
- This will bring up your text editor so you can enter a list of files or directories to ignore.
Set new value for property 'svn:ignore' on '.'
svn status
 M      .
svn commit . -m "Ignoring .classpath and bin."

Ã svn remove <filename>
- Removes from your file system.
- Donâ€™t forget you have to commit the remove, as with add.


Check Status

Ã svn status

Ã svn diff <filepath>


Add new files recursively

Ã svn add * --force


Ã Add all files marked as ?
for i in  $(svn status | grep \? | awk '{print $2}'); do svn add $i; done


Ã Delete all files marked as !
for i in  $(svn status | grep \! | awk '{print $2}'); do svn delete $i; done


Ã Commit with a message
svn commit -m "...message here..."


Rename a file
Renaming through SVN is better than doing it through the operating system, because SVN will automatically do the Add/Delete as well as maintain the history of the file. (That is, it will copy the history of the old file to the new fileâ€™s history.)
svn move oldName newName
