tables should not have the "id"
- In fact, it doesn't even need the "div"
- Change examples in floatingTable.html.
- Clean out of all code.
	- Search id="table"
	- Search id=&quot;table&quot;
	
floatedtable:
- caption side value doesn't seem to do anything; delete it and there are no changes.
- if I'm right, I need to remove it from floatingTable.html
- cellpadding doesn't seem to do much, either

precaption
- I don't think I'm using it right in preAndCode.html
- It's a class; shouldn't it be used with div instead of p?
