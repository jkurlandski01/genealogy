floatedtable:
- Reword floatingTable.html to include images

floated image on onTheTrail.html
- Collapse floatedFigure and floatedImage into a single style.
- This would mean updating floatingTable.html accordingly.

Not giving every page its own <title> (appears on the tab)
- The templates should have JERRY here

precaption
- I don't think I'm using it right in preAndCode.html
- It's a class; shouldn't it be used with div instead of p?

multimap
- Write & compile code with output.
- Put code and output onto page.

svnExamples
- only just started

browser issues
- In Safari with the left sidebar open, there is no left hand margin

svnCheatSheet
- needs a main index.html page

Kurlandski and other tables should have a caption
