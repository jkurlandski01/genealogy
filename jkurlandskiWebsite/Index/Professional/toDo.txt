Not using correct style for code snippets; follow floating.html
- hashBasedTable
- usingPreAndCode

htmlEntities
- needs proofing

svnExamples
- only just started

tables should not have the "id"
- In fact, it doesn't even need the "div"
- Change examples in floating.html.
- Clean out of all code.
	- Search id="table"
	- Search id=&quot;table&quot;
	
floatedtable:
- caption side value doesn't seem to do anything; delete it and there are no changes.
- if I'm right, I need to remove it from floating.html
- cellpadding doesn't seem to do much, either

browser issues
- In Safari with the left sidebar open, there is no left hand margin

svnCheatSheet
- needs a main index.html page
