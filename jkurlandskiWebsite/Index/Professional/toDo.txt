floatedtable:
- Adjust margin-left
- I'd rather border be set in the css style
- Fix floatingTable.html
- Kurlandski and other floating tables should have a caption

precaption
- I don't think I'm using it right in preAndCode.html
- It's a class; shouldn't it be used with div instead of p?

multimap
- Write & compile code with output.
- Put code and output onto page.

svnExamples
- only just started

browser issues
- In Safari with the left sidebar open, there is no left hand margin

svnCheatSheet
