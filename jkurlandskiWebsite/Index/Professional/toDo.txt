- Clean up the ConceptNetQuery code.
   - Put inner classes and enums into separate files.
   - Eliminate all but two tests.
- Post most of ConceptNetQuery and a couple of tests on a new page.

Multiset
- reference online, internal, and on the page
- Multisets union returns a SetView? See Java Interviews book.
- proofread

multimap
- See my local copy of GuavaCollectionTypes
- Multimap.get(key) always returns a non-null, possibly empty collection.
- old way section: NPE if you forget to check for null
- Summary section: instantation eg., get eg. iterate e.g.
- Proofread

MapSort
- start with summary section, like setOperations

hashtable for all data types
- specify the sort when you call sort; stores everything as a string

svnExamples
- only just started

browser issues
- In Safari with the left sidebar open, there is no left hand margin

svnCheatSheet
- needs a main index.html page
