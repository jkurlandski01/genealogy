multimap
- See my local copy of GuavaCollectionTypes
- I should be using the set version, not list
   - HashMultimap
- I've got the unit test, but haven't modified the .html; Need to discuss the ArrayList implementation
- Proofread

MapSort
- start with summary section, like setOperations

Make all page titles mixed case
- But I want the titles of the sidebars to remain all caps

hashtable for all data types
- specify the sort when you call sort; stores everything as a string

svnExamples
- only just started

browser issues
- In Safari with the left sidebar open, there is no left hand margin

svnCheatSheet
- needs a main index.html page

Kurlandski and other tables should have a caption.
