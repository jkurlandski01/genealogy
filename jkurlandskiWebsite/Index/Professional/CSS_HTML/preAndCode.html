				<h2>Using  &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt;</h2>
				<h2>to display code</h2>
			</div>
            <br/>
            
			<p>Sometimes website developers want to share a technique that they've discovered or found useful. Sometimes they simply want to set a few lines apart from the rest of the text on a web page. The &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt; tags are useful for this purpose.</p>
			<p><b>If you're in a hurry (or if you don't like to read):</b> Jump to the last two listings on this page.</p>
			
			<h3>Converting reserved HTML characters</h3>
			<p>When trying to display HTML and other programming code on a web page, one of the first obstacles that has to be overcome is the fact that certain characters, particularly angle brackets, are <em>reserved</em>. This means that browsers interpret these characters differently from other characters, and will <strong>not</strong> display them on the web page. To get these characters to display correctly, you have to type into your HTML not the character itself, but its <em>entity equivalent</em>.</p>
			<p>I explain HTML entities in greater detail on a separate page&mdash;see the link in the sidebar. On this page, we're concerned exclusively with those characters that you find in computer code. What you need to do to display HTML and most computer code on your web page is the following:</p>
            <ul class="style3">
                <li>replace the "&lt;" symbol with "&amp;lt;" (think "less than");</li>
                <li>replace the "&gt;" symbol with "&amp;gt;" (think "greater than"); </li>
                <li>replace the "&amp;" symbol (the ampersand) with "&amp;amp;".</li>
            </ul>
			
		<h3>Introducing the &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt; tags</h3>
		<p>Use the &lt;pre&gt; tag to set your code off from the regular formatting of the page. Compare the next few lines of CSS with the text of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="precaption">Listing 1: Your browser's default settings for &lt;pre&gt;.</p>
<pre>
someTag {
    margin: 0px;
    //3456789012
}
</pre>

		<p>Each browser has its own default version of this tag. Since &lt;pre&gt; is not defined in my CSS stylesheet, the snippet of code above illustrates your browser's default setting for rendering text surrounded by the pre tag. Most browswers will assign a monospace type to text wrapped by this tag.</p>
		<p>The next snippet contains the exactly the same text, but wrapped in the &lt;code&gt; tag instead.</p>
        
<p class="precaption">Listing 2: Your browser's default settings for &lt;code&gt;.</p>
<br/>
<code>
someTag {
    margin: 0px;
    //3456789012
}
</code>
		
		<p>You see that the &lt;code&gt; tag also assigns a monospace font, but it seems less useful, if only because browsers typically ignore the contents' newlines and collapse the whitespace. If whitespace is important in your display of code (and usually it is to the reader, if not the compiler), then you need &lt;pre&gt;. The &lt;code&gt; tag can be used for inline elements, like the following: <code>public static int HUNDRED = 100; </code></p>
		<p>Some will say that you should present blocks of code with both &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt;. But, so far, for blocks of HTML or other code, I am unpersuaded; incuding it just seems like extra work to me.</p>
		
		<h3>A pretty good pre tag styling</h3>
		<p>After some experimenting I finally found a style for &lt;pre&gt; that suits my needs. My first decision was whether to define the pre tag's styling, or to create my own class. Had I decided on the former, then all usages of the tag would have been determined by that style, making it impossible for me to use the default stylings. In other words, Listing 1 on this page would have been styled in exactly the same wasy as Listing 3. I decided I did not want that. So I created a new class, calling it "preCode," because its general behavior is like that of &lt;pre&gt;, and because its primary usage is to display code like HTML.</p>

<p class="precaption">Listing 3: A pretty good styling for displaying code with &lt;pre&gt;.</p>
<pre class="preCode">
pre.preCode
{
    font-family: "Courier New" Courier monospace;
    font-size: 0.80em;
    background: #E8E8E8;
    overflow: auto;
    padding: 10px;
    // a long commented out line that displays the scrolling feature if it is ever needed one: two three four five six seven eight nine ten  
}
</pre>

        <p>In the CSS snippet above, we first state that we're creating the preCode class. Then we say we want to use Courier or a similar monospace type, and we define the font size. Then we give the text a slightly tinted background. Then we handle lines that are too long with scrolling. Finally we want a little whitespace between the text and the edges of the gray box&mdash;otherwise the text abuts the edges and everything looks too crowded. The last line is not actually part of the CSS style; I inserted it simply in order to display how the overflow setting makes scrolling behave.</p>
        <p>Here's how to use the preCode class I've just defined.</p>

<p class="precaption">Listing 4: How to use the preCode style in HTML.</p>
<pre class="preCode">
&lt;pre class=&quot;preCode&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>

        <p>The ellipses represent whatever you want the viewer to see. Don't forget that whatever takes the place of these ellipses must have its angle brackets "escaped," as described in the separate section above.</p>
		<p>By the way, &lt;pre&gt; is so literal that you can't indent it. The next listing is the same as the above, but with the tags indented, as HTML normally is. Note the extra space at the bottom of the tinted window. That space is due to the whitespace between the left margin and the closing &lt;/pre&gt; tag.</p>

        <p class="precaption">Listing 5: The same as Listing 4, but with the tags indented.</p>
    <pre class="preCode">
     &lt;pre class=&quot;preCode&quot;&gt;
...
     &lt;/pre&gt;
        </pre>

        <p>The problem is, if you don't indent it, the code becomes a little harder to read; therefore, I find my HTML is clearest if I leave blank lines before and after my unindented &lt;pre&gt; blocks.</p>

        <h3>A styling for a pre block with captions</h3>
		<p>One thing I don't like about the pre blocks you've been looking at thus far is the spacing between the caption and the pre block window. Let's create a new style for the case when you want to assign a caption to this block (which for me is most of the time).</p>
 
<p class="precaption">Listing 6: A style for a preCode block with a caption, and the style of its caption.</p>
<pre class="preCodeWithCaption">
.precaption {
    line-height: 1;
    font-size: 10pt;
    font-family: 'FontAwesome';
    font-weight: 600;
    margin-bottom: 0px;
    padding-bottom: 0px;
}

pre.preCodeWithCaption
{
    margin-top: 0px;
    font-family: "Courier New" Courier monospace;
    font-size: 0.80em;
    background: #E8E8E8;
    overflow: auto;
    padding: 10px;
    // a long commented out line that displays the scrolling feature if it is ever needed one: two three four five six seven eight nine ten  
}
</pre>

        <p>The definition of the caption gives it some desirable characteristics, like a slightly smaller, slightly darker font. Note the bottom margin and padding, which are set to 0. These go hand-in-hand with the top margin of the preCodeWithCaption class. These values combine so that the caption appears to just touch the tinted block. Apart from the margin-top setting, the preCodeWithCaption class is identical to preCode.</p>
		<p>And here's how to use it in HTML.</p>

<p class="precaption">Listing 7: Using preCodeWithCaption, and giving your code block a caption.</p>
<pre class="preCodeWithCaption">
&lt;p class=&quot;precaption&quot;&gt;Your caption here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;preCodeWithCaption&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>
