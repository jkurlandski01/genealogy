Odd characters in html and ascii

& =  &amp;
< = &lt;
> =  &gt;

Explain how to get Aptana plug-in.

Aptana has a handy word-wrap option if you don't like scrolling to the right to read an entire line.
- Preferences > Aptana Studio > Editors
	- Check "Enable word wrap"
- Open the file in the Aptaba editor by right-clicking on it in the Package Explorer and going to Open with > and selecting the option having the < > symbols. (Need screenshot)

What the normal HTML editor has, which Aptana lacks, is the convenient Source > Toggle Comment menu option.
