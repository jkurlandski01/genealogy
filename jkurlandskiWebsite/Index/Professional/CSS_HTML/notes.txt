            <p>JERRY: There should be more space above the heading than below. Try adding this to .css</p>
            <pre>
#content p
{
    margin: 0px 0px 10px 0px;
}            </pre>
            <p>JERRY: look up entities and see how to use it; update pre and code page accordingly; I think the mention of this on each page refers the reader to the other page</p>
            
            
            maybe
            
            
            #content h3
{
	padding: 3px 0px 3px 0px;
	clear: both;
}

New page: Debugging with w3schools.com

This website is greater for learning about web programming, and even better for debugging and testing out your code. My favorite aspect of their website are the pages that let you insert your code onto a scrap sheet and see what it looks like. You’ll find it at http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_default or in the links at right.

Here’s a screenshot of this tool just when it helped me realize I had a slight bug in my style sheet.

You type or cut-and-paste your code in the left-hand panel. Then you click on the “See Result >>” button, and it is rendered in the right-hand panel.
