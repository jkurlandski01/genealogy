Explain how to get Aptana plug-in.

Aptana has a handy word-wrap option if you don't like scrolling to the right to read an entire line.
- Preferences > Aptana Studio > Editors
	- Check "Enable word wrap"
- Open the file in the Aptaba editor by right-clicking on it in the Package Explorer and going to Open with > and selecting the option having the < > symbols. (Need screenshot)

What the normal HTML editor has, which Aptana lacks, is the convenient Source > Toggle Comment menu option.



Using the Remote view

View > Other > Studio > Remote

Select
	⁃	target_jkurlandski.com

Whatever you do, make sure your FTP inserts into the jkurlandski.com directory, not above it.
	⁃	See “Website Notes” document.

Right-click > Transfer Files

Blue arrows (Synchronize)
