JERRY: New page with the following. (Perhaps create screenshots.) (1) Eclipse and converting HTML for display. Commands > HTML > Entities > Convert Character / Selection to Entities. 

Use of Eclipse plug-in
This taken from Aptana page because apparently it's not Aptana:
<li>Has a command that converts angle brackets and ampersands to "HTML entities"</li>
            <h4>Aptana can automatically convert angle brackets to HTML entities</h4>
            <p>Because angle brackets indicate a tag in HTML, if you want to display a bracket you have to tell the browser not to read the angle bracket as the start of a tag. You do this by replacing the characters with what are called <em>HTML entities</em>. So, to display &lt;p&gt;, you must type in this: &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;  I discuss this more thoroughly on the "Using &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;code&gt;" page in this section of the website. The point here is that Aptana offers an extremely useful tool that will do this for you. To use the tool click on the Commands menu item at top and go to HTML > Entities > Convert Character / Selection to Entities. You can also get there by right-clicking. Note that, the first time you use it, the command might take several seconds to perform the conversion.</p>

New page: Debugging with w3schools.com

This website is greater for learning about web programming, and even better for debugging and testing out your code. My favorite aspect of their website are the pages that let you insert your code onto a scrap sheet and see what it looks like. You’ll find it at http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_default or in the links at right.

Here’s a screenshot of this tool just when it helped me realize I had a slight bug in my style sheet.

You type or cut-and-paste your code in the left-hand panel. Then you click on the “See Result >>” button, and it is rendered in the right-hand panel.

Basic css syntax:

http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_selectors.asp

The element Selector
The element selector selects elements based on the element name.

You can select all <p> elements on a page like this: (all <p> elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color)

Example

p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}



The id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML tag to find the specific element.

An id should be unique within a page, so you should use the id selector when you want to find a single, unique element.

To find an element with a specific id, write a hash character, followed by the id of the element.

The style rule below will be applied to the HTML element with id="para1":

Example

#para1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}

The class Selector
The class selector finds elements with the specific class.

The class selector uses the HTML class attribute.

To find elements with a specific class, write a period character, followed by the name of the class:

In the example below, all HTML elements with class="center" will be center-aligned:

Example

.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}


You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

In the example below, all p elements with class="center" will be center-aligned:

Example

p.center {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}
