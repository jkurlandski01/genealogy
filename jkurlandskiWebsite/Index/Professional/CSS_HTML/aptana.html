				<h2>The Aptana Eclipse Plug-In</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Aptana's Eclipse plug-in offers a few very useful tools. This page will give you a quick run-down on how to get them, and how to use them. The Aptana website boasts that it is useful for development with Javascript, Ruby on Rails, PHP and Python--in addition to CSS and HTML. I have not used it for the former. For working with HTML, the tool is a big help in that it:</p>
            <ul class="style3">
                <li>Automatically inserts matching tags</li>
                <li>Wraps lines (especially useful on a laptop)</li>
                <li>Has a command that converts angle brackets and ampersands to "HTML entities"</li>
                <li>Allows remote system synchronization</li>
            </ul>
			<h3>Installing Aptana</h3>
			<p>You cannot use the Eclipse Marketplace to get the Aptana plug-in. You have to go to their website and jump through a few hoops But the features described above make it worth your while. Here, then, is how I managed to install it, after several fruitless attempts by other means. (Two things worth noting: (1) For some reason the download wouldn't work on the Mac version of Firefox--I had to use Safari. And (2), this is how I installed Aptana 3.6.0 onto the STS version of Eclipse in November of 2014--of course, anything could change at some point in the future.)</p>
			<p>Go to http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3/download, or if that link is dead, search on "download Aptana studio eclipse". You're looking for a page that has the radio buttons and the download button like the image below. It's not immediately apparent, but the download page has two options--the Standalone Version (the default) or the Eclipse Plug-in Version. See the radio button the red arrow is pointing at. Make sure you select the plug-in version, then click the Download button.</p>
            <img id="fileIMG" src="./aptanaFirstInstallPage.jpg" />
            <p>The above steps bring you to a new page. The instructions will tell you to copy a URL to your clipboard and install from Eclipse. I found the remainder of the install process pretty easy.</p>
			<h3>Aptana's annoying apostrophe issue</h3>
			<p>By default, Aptana auto-closes matching character pairs. What this means is that when you type the first of a "character pair" (for example, the left-hand side of a pair of parentheses or curly bracer, or single- or double-quotes), it automatically types the matching right-hand side of the pair for you. Your job is simply to fill the inside of the pair with whatever you want to type; then you hit the Tab key, which brings your cursor to the outisde of the pair, and you can go on your merry way with whatever you want to type.</p>
			<p>This can come in handy. The problem is that Aptana considers the single quote a matching pair. And the single quote is the same as an apostrophe. Which means that whenever you use an abbreviation--or the possessive "'s", you end up with an unnecessary matching apostrophe which is a pain to delete.</p>
