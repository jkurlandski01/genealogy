As of 7/21/2015:
Web Page title: Set Operations on Java Sets and Lists
Link title: Java set operations with Guava

Guava Table
- My Note could say: I'm still exploring, but eager to share what I've discovered so far.


On every page:
- √ Every page needs a <br/> between title and first line of text.

Use traditional capitalization for section headings and listing titles

Handy symbols:
- Replace "--" with &mdash;
- Use copyright symbol, &copy;

? commandLine.html, and others in misc
- Want paragraph titles that are code to be monospaced
- e.g. "perl -p -e 's/\t/\n/g' data.txt" in commandLine.html


Editing Tasks
- http://www.jkurlandski.com/svn/jkurlandski/jkurlandskiWebsite/Index/Professional/index.html
- Comment on website title "Close to the Machine."
- Research how best to edit a website: printed copies vs. Word documents
- Check presentation on multiple Windows browsers
- Check load-time of pages/images with wired and wireless connections
- Verify all links, internal and external
- Low-level proofreading, including spell-checking
- Low-level editing of page layout
- Low-level editing of figure, table and image titles
- Low-level verification of "tab titles" for each page
- Edit with regard to "professionalism"; 
	- ? both professional and non-professional sites
- High-level edit with regard to standard Internet "practices"
- High-level edit with regard to consistency across the website as a whole, e.g. use of capitalization in titles and subtitles
- ? After checking with me, edit the HTML yourself

Four unit tests fail:
	- guavatable: pairElementsTestFails
	- guavatests: testOldWayFails
	- testListAddAllFails
	- testListRetainAllFails
		
Call the summary sections "Quick View" or "Snapshot"?
