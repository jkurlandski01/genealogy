Figure out how to use www.closeToTheMachine.net.
- I think I have to either:
	- Have closeToTheMachine.net redirect to jkurlandski
		- But then I lose the URL
	- Have separate repositories, or repository directories, for Professional, Family, Personal

? commandLine.html, and others in misc
- Want paragraph titles that are code to be monospaced

- Low-level proofreading, including spell-checking
- Low-level editing of page layout
- Low-level editing of figure, table and image titles
- Low-level verification of "tab titles" for each page
- Edit with regard to "professionalism"; 
	- ? both professional and non-professional sites
- High-level edit with regard to standard Internet "practices"
- High-level edit with regard to consistency across the website as a whole, e.g. use of capitalization in titles and subtitles
- ? After checking with me, edit the HTML yourself
