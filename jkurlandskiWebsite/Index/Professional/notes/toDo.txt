Do main professional index page
- Check Verity Stobbs and other links

Why is Guava table stuff now failing?

Do every section's index page.

Move contact, etc. to professional page.
- Keep at home page, probably. Remove from Geneology.

Call the summary sections "Quick View" or "Snapshot"?

hashtable for all data types
- specify the sort when you call sort; stores everything as a string

browser issues
- Check with different browsers, different operatin systems
- In Safari with the left sidebar open, there is no left hand margin

In every section:
- Remove unused pages.
- Go through the notes/to do page.

Proof all pages.

Search for JERRY comments.
