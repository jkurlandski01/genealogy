			<p>JERRY: use preCodeWithCaption for code blocks</p>
			<p>There are a couple of ways to sort on the keys of a map. You could: (1) use Java's TreeMap, or (2) get the key set and sort that. If your requirements are as simple as that, this page will help you out. If your requirements are more complicated, you might want to explore Guava's Table interface and its various implementations. I have a few pages dedicated to making use of Guave to implement a table data structure that can be sorted on any of its various columns. See the links at right.</p>
            <p>This page is probably intended for the fairly novice programmer, since the Java code here is not complicated. But sometimes I forget exactly how to use the sorting techniques outlined here. Or sometimes I forget exactly how to convert a Set to an array. I wrote this page to serve as a quick reference for myself and others. Here is a pretty comprehensive list of the things this page covers:</p>
            <ul class="style3">
                <li>Using TreeMap</li>
                <li>Sorting with Collections.sort() and Arrays.sort()</li>
                <li>Converting a Set to arrays and Lists</li>
                <li>Why developers often prefer a List to an array</li>
                <li>An introduction to initializing with Guava</li>
                <li>A few tips to get you started on sorting on custom classes</li>
            </ul>
			
			<h3>Using TreeMap</h3>
			<p>The listing below shows you how to use a TreeMap, which is a specialized Java map that returns the keys in sorted order.</p>
			<p class="precaption">Listing 1: Using TreeMap to get the keys of a map in sorted order</p>
            <pre class="withCaption">
TreeMap&lt;String, Double&gt; map1 = new TreeMap&lt;String, Double&gt;();
map1.put(&quot;one&quot;, new Double(1.0));
map1.put(&quot;two&quot;, new Double(2.0));
map1.put(&quot;three&quot;, new Double(3.0));
        
// Convert to list for convenience.
List&lt;String&gt; keyList = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;(map1.keySet());
            </pre>
            <p>The call to keySet() returns the keys of the map sorted alphabetically. I convert it to a List of strings because, often, that's the form you need it in. If you don't need a list of strings, simply iterate through the keys returned by keySet().</p>
            <p>The above code initializes the map and the list in the traditional Java 1.6 way. If you have Guava you can do both more simply, thus:</p>
            <p class="precaption">Listing 2: Using TreeMap, initializing with Guava</p>
            <pre class="withCaption">
TreeMap&lt;String, Double&gt; map1 = Maps.newTreeMap();
map1.put(&quot;one&quot;, new Double(1.0));
map1.put(&quot;two&quot;, new Double(2.0));
map1.put(&quot;three&quot;, new Double(3.0));
        
// Convert to list for convenience.
List&lt;String&gt; keyList = Lists.newArrayList(map1.keySet());
            </pre>
            <p>One more note on Guava. Notice that it took us four lines to initialize and load the map. Wouldn't it be nice if we could do it more succinctly? As far as I've been able to figure out, you can't with a TreeMap. But with other data structures the Guava libraries offer initializers that let you instantiate and initialize in a single line of code--you'll one example below with a HashMap in Listing 3, and you'll see other examples of this on other pages of this website.</p>
            <p>Finally, a caution about runtime. Don't be cavalier in your use of TreeMap. Its various operations--get, put, containsKey and remove--are O(log n), which is very good in the sorting sphere but not so good for hashmaps in general. In other words, if you don't need to sort, use the HashMap implementation, whose get and put operations are O(1).</p>
            
            <h3>Using Arrays.sort() and Collections.sort()</h3>
            <p>If you know in advance that an essential part of a map's usage will be sorting on its keys, you can decide to use a TreeMap. Other times, you don't know until its too late, or you're using someone else's map, and this map is a HashMap or some other implementation that does not offer sorted keys. In these cases you have to do the sorting yourself.</p>
            <p>The listings below show you how to sort the keys of a map in two ways--with either Arrays.sort() or Collections.sort(). Note that I'm dispensing with the normal Java initialization of the map, and using Guava instead.</p>
            <p class="precaption">Listing 3: Using Arrays.sort() to sort the keys of a map</p>
            <pre class="withCaption">
Map&lt;String, Double&gt; map = Maps.newHashMap(ImmutableMap.of(&quot;one&quot;, new Double(1), &quot;two&quot;, 
                new Double(2), &quot;three&quot;, new Double(3), &quot;four&quot;, new Double(4)));
        
Set&lt;String&gt; keys = map.keySet();
String[] keysArray = keys.toArray((new String[keys.size()]));
Arrays.sort(keysArray);

System.out.println(&quot;Printing the sorted keys array.&quot;);
System.out.println(keysArray.toString());
System.out.println(&quot;Printing the sorted keys array after converting it to a list.&quot;);
List&lt;String&gt; keysList = Arrays.asList(keysArray);
System.out.println(keysList);

Output:
Printing the sorted keys array.
[Ljava.lang.String;@513bd574
Printing the sorted keys array after converting it to a list.
[four, one, three, two]
            </pre>
            <p>After initializing our map and getting the key set, we use the tricky toArray() method to convert the Set to an array. (I always forget how to do that!) Arrays.sort() does the heavy lifting for us, and we write out the result.</p>
            <p>Only calling toString() on an array doesn't quite give you what you want. Sure, the elements are sorted--it's just that you can't easily display them. (Also, they're not type safe!) So I convert the array to a list, and then write out the contents.</p>
            <p>For the reasons given in the above paragraph, I often prefer a List over and array. The next listing shows you how to get the map's keys into a sorted list.</p>
            <p class="precaption">Listing 4: Using Collections.sort() to sort the keys of a map</p>
            <pre class="withCaption">
Map&lt;String, Double&gt; map = Maps.newHashMap(ImmutableMap.of(&quot;one&quot;, new Double(1), &quot;two&quot;, 
    new Double(2), &quot;three&quot;, new Double(3), &quot;four&quot;, new Double(3)));
        
Set&lt;String&gt; keys = map.keySet();
List&lt;String&gt; keyList = Lists.newArrayList(keys);
Collections.sort(keyList);

System.out.println(&quot;Printing the sorted key list.&quot;);
System.out.println(keyList.toString());

Output:
Printing the sorted key list.
[four, one, three, two]
            </pre>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>When your key is a custom class.</strong> If your key is a custom value class instead of String, Double, Integer and so on, don't forget to override the necessary methods for safe sorting and the insertion of your class objects into containers. For example, instead of sorting on movie title, maybe you have a Movie class that wraps the movie data into a single object. There are three methods you'll need to override: in the Object class, you'll want to override equals() and hashCode(); and you'll want to declare your class as implementing Comparable and override compareTo(). Chances are you should consider overriding Object.toString() as well. All of this is covered beautifully in Chapter 3 of Joshua Bloch's <em>Effective Java</em>.</p>
