Working with mysql from the command line

Suppose you repeatedly have to run a slightly different version of the same query. For example, suppose you have to run the following query multiple times, but with a different response_pool_id each time.

SELECT * FROM response_pool_entry LEFT JOIN response_pool_entry_flavor ON response_pool_entry.response_pool_entry_id = response_pool_entry_flavor.response_pool_entry_id where response_pool_entry.response_pool_id = 14 UNION SELECT * FROM response_pool_entry RIGHT JOIN response_pool_entry_flavor ON response_pool_entry.response_pool_entry_id = response_pool_entry_flavor.response_pool_entry_id where response_pool_entry.response_pool_id = 14 order by response_template;

Its a pain to backspace, or even ...

If you're familiar with vi this might be easier for you.

Use the Up arrow to scroll up to the query you want to edit.

Append \e to the query. Hit Enter. This will open the query in vi.

Use the :s command to do a global replace on the query. For example, to replace 14 with 16, type the following:

:s/14/16/g

Hit ZZ to save and exit.

You'll be see the following as your prompt:
    ->
Type in semi-colon and hit Enter.
