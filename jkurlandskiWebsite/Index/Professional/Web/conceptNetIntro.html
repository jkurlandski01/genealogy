				<h2>Intro to ConceptNet</h2>
			</div>
			<p>ConceptNet is an open-source database which is meant to represent real-world knowledge in a form that computers can understand. It comes from the folks at MIT, but they built it upon other publicly-available databases such as WordNet and DBPedia.</p>
			<p>The external links in the sidebar will get you started if you want to find out more. It looks like the documentation was updated in November of 2014 and is now much better than it used to be.</p>
			<p>Also in the sidebar is an internal link which will take you to a separate page where you'll find some basic Java code for retrieving ConceptNet information.</p>
			
			<h3>Getting Started</h3>
			<p>Take ConceptNet out for a test drive by going to <a href="http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/">ConceptNet Home</a>. At the top of the page you'll see two input boxes and a Search button. Type in, for example, the word "throat," leave the Language box unchanged, and hit Search.</p>
			<p>The results page for your search will appear. This will give you a good sense of the kind of information that ConceptNet provides. I won't analyze it in detail here--their documentation is good enough--but let me point out that what you are looking at shows your search term on both the left- and the right-hand side of a number of <b>relations</b>. For example:</p>
<p class="precaption">Partial Result of a ConceptNet Search on "throat"</p>
<pre class="preCodeWithCaption">
throat -- IsA --> external body part 
     
throat -- PartOf --> neck
a throat is part of a neck.
</pre>

        <p>In the examples above, the two relations are IsA and PartOf. Some of the entries also provide a <b>gloss</b>, in this case the sentence "a throat is part of a neck."</p>
        <p>ConceptNet is called a "semantic network" because the real-world information which it holds is implemented as a graph (in the mathematical or computer science sense of the word). A graph contains vertices and edges which connect the vertices. In the first example of above, "throat" and "external body part" are two vertices which are connected by the edge whose relation is IsA. The relation is just one of many properties of an edge; most if not all of ConceptNet's knowledge is contained in its edge objects.</p>
        
        <p>At the top-right of the page you see a link labeled "Get /c/en/throat in JSON format." Clicking on that brings you to the JSON representation of what ConceptNet understands about throats. Experimentation will show that the JSON format page usually includes more entries that the normal web page version (or at least it did in the summer of 2014--perhaps the behavior is different now).</p>
        <p>Scroll to the bottom of the JSON page and you see that numFound is set to 50. This means that the query in the URL of the page--"http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/data/5.3/c/en/throat"--by default returned 50 entries for the term "throat." You can adjust the number of entries returned by modifying the URL. For example, a URL of "http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/data/5.3/c/en/throat?limit=100" returns 100 entries.</p>
        <p>Multi-word searches require that the words be separated by the underscore character. So a search on "http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/data/5.3/c/en/strep_throat?limit=100" tells you what ConceptNet understands about strep throat. You'll see that, even though you set the limit to 100, only 15 entries were returned. ConceptNet "knows" only 15 things about this malady.</p>
        
        <p>As you can see, the top-level syntax of the JSON string returned is something like this:</p>
<p class="precaption">Syntax of a ConceptNet Search Result in JSON Format</p>
<pre class="preCodeWithCaption">
{
  &quot;edges&quot;: [
    {
        edge_1
    },
    (...)
    {
        edge_n
    }
  ],
  &quot;numFound&quot;: n&lt;/n&gt;
}

n = number entries retrieved
</pre>

        <p>The edge syntax is more complicated. Recall from the discussion above that the edge is the link between two nodes. Here is an example of a ConceptNet edge that connects "strep throat" to "painful."</p>
<p class="precaption">ConceptNet Edge Linking "strep throat" to "painful"</p>
<pre class="preCodeWithCaption">
{
      "context": "/ctx/all",
      "dataset": "/d/conceptnet/4/en",
      "end": "/c/en/painful",
      "features": [
        "/c/en/strep_throat /r/HasProperty -",
        "/c/en/strep_throat - /c/en/painful",
        "- /r/HasProperty /c/en/painful"
      ],
      "id": "/e/a9888855b0370a4967e3c0a21c704f6c9368591b",
      "license": "/l/CC/By-SA",
      "rel": "/r/HasProperty",
      "source_uri": "/and/[/s/activity/omcs/response_to_picture/,/s/contributor/omcs/tenfiveoh/]",
      "sources": [
        "/s/activity/omcs/response_to_picture",
        "/s/contributor/omcs/tenfiveoh"
      ],
      "start": "/c/en/strep_throat",
      "surfaceText": "[[Strep throat]] is [[painful]]",
      "uri": "/a/[/r/HasProperty/,/c/en/strep_throat/,/c/en/painful/]",
      "weight": 1.5849625007211563
}
</pre>

        <p>Note that these edge properties pertain to version 5.3, the latest as of December 2014; version 5.2's are significantly different. The most useful properties are rel (relation), start (the left-hand side of the relation), end (the right-hand side of the relation), surfaceText (the gloss) and dataset (the source of the information--as in WordNet, DBPedia, and so on).</p>
        <p>To make effective use of ConceptNet, you will need to filter out undesirable information; how you decide what is undesirable will depend on your needs. In my own work, I have never found the weight indicative of either the usefulness or the accuracy of the information. Generally I find myself filtering out according to the relation or the dataset.</p>

            <h3>ConceptNet Issues and Problems</h3>
            <p>Although I believe that ConceptNet could prove to be an invaluable resource for artificial intelligence applications, using the semantic network is not all sugar and spice. Here I give a quick list of the kinds of issues you will occasionally encounter as you work with ConceptNet. I first discovered these issues in version 5.2, but I've checked and all of them still exist as of 5.3. Still, even if they are fixed in later versions, the problems I describe below give you a sense of what to expect if you decide to try to use ConceptNet in your own application.</p>
            
            <h4>Misinformation</h4>
            <p>As with any database, especially one whose information is partially crowd-sourced, some "facts" are just plain wrong. For example, "Starry, Starry Night" is not a song about Picasso; in fact, Don McLean was writing about Van Gogh, who did the painting of the same name. (The song's true title is "Vincent.") To replicate this problem, remember you have to search on "starry_starry_night," with underscores.</p>
            <p>You can see another case of misinformation by doing a lookup on "girl_friend." One of the relations returned states that "A fox muffler is a metaphor of a girl friend" (fox muffler -- SymbolOf --> girl friend). Perhaps so, somewhere, but not in anything I've ever read or seen or heard.</p>

            <h4>Uninteresting Information</h4>
            <p>Sometimes ConceptNet's facts, though incontrovertible, do not seem as though they would be useful in any context. For example, a search on "mom" returns, for two of its edges, "Moms can cook chicken soup" (mom -- CapableOf --> cook chicken soup) and "Moms can be great doctors" (mom -- CapableOf --> great doctor). Similarly, a search on "lady" returns "A lady can butter a roll" (lady -- CapableOf --> butter roll). There seems to be no easy way to filter out this kind of "empty" information.</p>

            <h4>Typographical Errors</h4>
            <p>Sometimes ConceptNet falls victim to the pre-computer age typographical error. I was doing look-ups on "mouth" and came across the following assertion: "Lilcs do not have a mouth" (lilcs -- NotHasA --> mouth). There is no such thing as a "lilc." Somebody somewhere mistyped something.</p>

            <h4>SurfaceText (Gloss) Issues</h4>
            <p>The surfaceText property of an edge cannot always be relied upon to be in error-free English. For example, a search on bus returns an edge with the gloss, "You are likely to find a bus in a bus stop." Of course, it should read "at a bus stop." Another example can be found when you search on "engine" and read "Aeroplane has engine"--correct English would have either "An aeroplane has an engine" or "Aeroplanes have engines."</p>
            <p>Occasionally I notice that ConceptNet has a fact right, but its gloss phrases the fact in an odd, unnatural-sounding way. For instance, "A statement 'a ghost can be a supposed apparition of a dead person or animal.' helps answer the question 'what is a ghost?'" is what you see when you see when you search on "ghost."</p>

            <h4>Odd Formulations</h4>
            <p>I call this category "Odd Formulations" for lack of a better term. They are similar to the grammar problems in the glosses, but it's as if the error is in the relation itself. Examples include: ""[[life]] does not want to [[be sad]]" (life -- NotDesires --> be_sad) and ""If you want to [[tell a story]] then you should [[know]]" (tell_story -- HasPrerequisite --> know).</p>
            <p>Here is one more example of a problem in this category. One sense of the word "brother" is its use in a religious context; so ConceptNet, rightly, gives the term the following relation:</p>

<pre class="preCode">
brother -- HasContext --> religion 
</pre>

        <p>The problem is that ConceptNet then proceeds to use WordNet's gloss for "religion," which is "a strong belief in a supernatural power or powers that control human destiny." So, although the above relation seems natural, correct, indeed "human," the final result does not:</p>
<pre class="preCode">
brother -- HasContext --> a strong belief in a supernatural power or powers that control human destiny 
</pre>

        <p>As far as I've been able to make out so far, you cannot predict many of these kinds of problems in advance. In other words, they cannot be dealt with globally, but only on an ad hoc basis.</p>
